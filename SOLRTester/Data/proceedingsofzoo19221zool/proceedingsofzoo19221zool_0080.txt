42 DK. W. RAE SHERRIFPS ON EVOLUTION 

with ventrally and laterally nothing more than minute cylindrical 
 corpuscles. D.fusca with indefinite double rows of about 6 pairs — 
 on a slightly higher level, but also showing primitiveness in 
 numerous quite small elements. D. savignyi with indefinite 
 steep double rows reduced to 6— somewhat higher, but also 
 showing, like the preceding, very numerous small cylindrical 
 bodies. 

2. In the hemprichi group : — 

Z>. clavata, where occur 10-12 pairs in each double row and a 
 veiy weak supporting bundle. It may be noted that in this 
 group we have a gradual reduction in the number of spicules 
 composing each point 5-7, 5-6, 4, 3, 2 and 1, reaching a climax 
 in forms like D. pimicea, where are found a couple of slightly 
 hockey-club like spicules occupying the whole area which in 
 D. davata, for instance, shows 10-12 pairs. 

3. In the studeri group : — 

Here we have, on the whole, a more differentiated group with 
 forms like D. mayi with 6-8 pairs in each point to be ranked 
 as relatively primitive compared with the highly-specialized 
 D. kollikeri. 

§ 11. So with the Divaricates, on my view the series begins 
 with forms like D. japonica with 8 pairs in each point, none 
 protruding — a very primitive arrangement — and ends with 
 D. suensoni, which has but one pair. As intermediate between 
 grade II., which I define as having numerous pairs regularly 
 arranged in each point (grade I. possessing very numerous 
 irregular pairs), and grade III., with 5-6 equal pairs, we have 
 cases like D. armata, where the lateral points go up to 9 pairs. 
 There must also be noticed D. coeridea inclining to be primitive in 
 minuteness but not in number of spicules, while D. Munzingeri 
 may be considered as rising out of grade II. because one of the 
 uppermost pairs is very prominent. 

It is interesting to see that in so many of Kiikenthal's minor 
 groups his arrangement of the species ends in one pair, so that 
 the anthocodial armature, which I hold to be the evolutionary 
 key, is, as used by Kiikenthal, very probably just diagnostic. 

Again, in the rigida group, D. microspiculata is undoubtedly 
 primitive with 6-8 pairs, though the uppermost again is slightly 
 larger and projecting. 

§ 12. In the third great division— the Umbellates — grade I. is 
 represented by D. australis with its very numerous, small polyp 
 spicules, grade II. perhaps by D. umhellulifera with 6-8 pairs and 
 the practical absence of a supporting bundle. 

In the dendrophyta group, Z>. viUosa belongs to grade I. with 
 many spicules in each double row, while grade II. in the florida 
 group may be illustrated by D. brevirama (with 6-8) and D. florida 
 (with 5-7).
