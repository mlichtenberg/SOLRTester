relatively little variability of architecture, though there are, of 
 course, quantitative differences in size of spicules, strength of 
 supporting bundle, and the like, which are merely growth 
 characters. I must emphasize the saving clause in most cases, 
 in view of the occurrence of a number of very variable species, 
 such as D. gigantea, where there is great variability of antho- 
 codial armature in one and the same colony. In the second part 
 of this paper particular attention is paid to the interesting form 
 referred to ; and it does not stand alone.

I. («). It may be urged that the observed differences are 
 indivichial, not specific, characters. If the observed differences 
 are purely individual, they may be either extrinsic modifications 
 or of the nature of intrinsic variations. And before considering 
 these alternatives separately, I may note the general answer 
 that in many cases a considerable number of specimens from the 
 same or difterent localities agree together. Thus Kitkenthal 
 speaks of twenty specimens of D. savignyi, twelve of B. gigantea, 
 ten of D. rubra, seven of D. pumilio ; while I have myself got 
 twelve of D. ehrenbergi, ten of D. gigantea, ten of D. clavata, eight 
 of J), habereri, and the same number of I), hyalina. 

Therefore the general suggestion that observed differences are 
 purely individual does not apply in every case. At the same 
 time, the unsatisfactoriness of basing a new species on a single 
 specimen when the specific characters are of such a tenuous 
 description is plain. 

(6) It may be said that the observed' differences are of the 
 nature of exogenous modifications correlated with environmental 
 peculiarities. Ag-ainst a too ready acceptance of this easy 
 solution is the occurrence of the same form in widely separated 
 localities. For example, D. robttsta is reported from Ternate, 
 Borneo, Zanzibar, and Madagascar ; D. florida from Hong Kong, 
 the Philippines, and Port Jackson (Australia). 

It may also be pointed out that certain factors in the 
 immediate environment in different parts of a large colony must 
 show considerable diversity, cf. shelter ; and yet, as already 
 pointed out, there is rarely diversity in a colony except in colour 
 and the like. 

(c) It may be, however, that the observed differences are 
 expressions of individual intrinsic vai'iability, not correlated with 
 any peculiarities of environment. Thei-e is no way of testing this 
 interpretation until numerous similar specimens from the same 
 locality and of the same age and size are examined by some 
 investigator with abundance of living material at his disposal. 

II. It may be that the multiplicity of distinct forms within a 
 nan^ow range is due to cross-fertilization between allied species.
