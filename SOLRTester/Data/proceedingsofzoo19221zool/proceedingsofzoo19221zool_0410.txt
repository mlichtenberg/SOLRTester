cover that they are difficult to stalk. Attempts to descend upoa' 
 them from above down a hill-side genei\ally resulted in failure,, 
 as they were very quick iu spotting any movement above. When 
 jilarmed they get off the mark more rapidly than any other 
 Antelope I know. Even when lying down they are up and away 
 with the quickness of thought, but always stop to look round 
 after going two or three hundred yards. The action is smooth,, 
 botli in the trot and gallop, and dose to the ground, with the 
 nose stretched out, the horns thrown back, and the neck not 
 appreciably raised. The heavily tufted tail streams out behind 
 at the gallop, but when trotting is svf ished from side to side. 

Gemsbuck are very keen-sighted, and when their suspicions 
 are aroused Avill continue to stare steadily at the spot from which 
 they sense danger with great persistency, and will detect the 
 slightest movement behind any but dense cover. 1 remember 
 one morning watching a herd, after grazing on some distant 
 stony flats, wander ofF and take up a resting position on a 
 shoulder connecting two quartz-topped kopjes which appeared to 
 be very favourably situated for a stalk. After making a detour 
 of several miles to approach one of the kopjes from a flank, 
 I climbed to the top of the great white boulders and peered over- 
 into the pass immediately beneath. For the first moment I saw 
 nothing but a stretch of glaring sand and some thorn-biishes. 
 The next the whole herd magically leapt into view. Each member 
 of it was standing perfectly motionless beneath me — most of them 
 in the open, a few under bushes. They looked absolutely trans- 
 parent, their outlines fusing into the reddish sand. Yet every 
 detail w^as there, foi- they were very near. I have often before 
 been struck by this curious efiect, especially with Oryx. It appears 
 to be due to the pei'fect toning of the body-colour with a back- 
 ground of sand or light stone, and to the fact that the black 
 markings are exactly the same tone as the shadows thrown b}^ 
 any solid object under intensely bright shimmering light. For 
 instance, the black markings of an Oryx standing under a thin 
 thorn-bush through Avhich the light penetrates, become so per- 
 fectly fused with the shadow^s thrown by the branches that it is. 
 impossible to detect, even with powerful field-glasses, where the 
 solid marking leaves off and the shadow begins. This I have 
 often tested. 

The Gemsbuck cows in this country drop their calves in 
 •January. They are curious little creatures with large ears, short 
 necks, and of a grizzled fawn-colour, and I remember once mis- 
 taking one that I saw ii\ the distance cantering after its mother 
 for a hunting-dog. The dark markings first appear in indistinct 
 tones of greyish brown diffused about the areas, which are even- 
 tually occupied by the black bands in more concentrated form. 
 The white markings on face and legs have not yet been assumed. 
 The bulls at this time are generally away from the herds. 
 1 counted two herds composed entirely of cows, one of sixteen 
 and the other of ten.
