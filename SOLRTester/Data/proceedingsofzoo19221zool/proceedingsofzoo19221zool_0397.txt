appears also to be greyer. There does not, therefore, seem to be 
 a line of geographical progression from grey to fulvous in any 
 given direction; but material on which to work is sadly deficient. 

There are no difl'erences to be detected in skulls from nny of

A neio Oribi. 

OUREBIA RUTILUS, Sp. n. 

A beautiful Oribi, distinguished by its brilliant colour, wavy 
 or curly hair, and the obsolescence of the bare patch below the 
 ear. 

Skin. — Colour of upper parts uniform tawny orange, changing 
 abruptly to white underneath. The Avhite area extends higher 
 on the flanks than usual. Inside of ears, superciliary stripe, 
 lips, chin, and throat white. Back of forelegs, hoofs, and of 
 hindlegs to hocks white. There remains a slight trace only of 
 the usual round subauricular patch, this area being almost com- 
 pletely covered with fine, short, huffish hairs. Tail black and very 
 short, about 30 mm. Skull rather long and narrow, with long 
 nasals, flat straight profile, and comparatively shallow laciymal 
 pits. Dimensions of typical skull: length 177 mm., breadth 
 75 mm., nasals 67 mm., upper tooth-row 52 mm. 

Hab. The country between the Quanza and Luando Rivers, 
 Angola,. 

Type. Ad. (S , skin and skull, B.M. no. 20.4.27.40. Collected 
 and presented by G. Blaine. 

There are six specimens of this Oribi in the B. M. collection 
 from the above locality — two males and four females, all adult, 
 shot by the writer in the autumn of 1919. They are remarkably 
 uniform in colour, one specimen only, a female, differing from 
 the rest in having a blackish patch on the crown. In one char- 
 acter, viz. the suppression of the subauricular patch, they show 
 some affinity to the Cape Oribi, but have much shorter tails, 
 so short, in fact, as to be almost rudimentary. 0. hastata from 
 Nyasaland has a pronounced bare subauricular patch. jSTeither 
 has the long curly hair and brilliant colouring of this species. 

In comparing skulls, those of Oribis from the Cape are rela- 
 tively shorter and broader, with shoi-t nasals; those from Rhodesia 
 and Kyasaland are longer and narrower, with long nasals. The 
 skulls of 0. rutilus approximate the latter, but are straighter in 
 pvofile than either and have shallower lacrymal pits.
