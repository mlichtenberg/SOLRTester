The female tail is slightly bent dorsally. It narrows gradually 
 to its tip, whicli is slightly rounded. There is apparently no 
 papillse on the female tail. The length of the tail is 0-36 mm.

 closely packed that it was impossible to arrive at an approximate 
 estimate of their length.

Baylis described fully P. indicum and P. africana. He was

 P. smithii, as Cobbold's description was not full. For this 
 reason the latter species is described here in full. It is certainly 
 a different species from P. indicum. although found in the 
 same host. It is a much smaller worm, and the measm-ements 
 of its various organs are likewise shorter than the corresponding 
 figures of P. indicum. 

The shape of the auricular appendages is different from that 
 alluded to above. The African species is of very great length, and

Evans and Rennie record the presence of a microfilaria in blood 
 taken from an elephant during the daytime. It measured 180 /i 
 in length and Q fj. in breadth. It is possible that it was really 
 a microfilaria, but I suggest that it is more probable that the
