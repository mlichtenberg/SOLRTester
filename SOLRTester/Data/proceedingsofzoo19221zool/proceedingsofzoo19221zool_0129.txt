OF THE WATER-BEKTJiK PELOBllJS TAllUUS. 85 

I tiiouglit jvt iii'st tliat the beetle jiulged her distance by inean.s 
 of the palpi feeling their way, but, as I have mentioned, these 
 organs do not invavitibly keep contsict with the stem, while the 
 gonapophyses do, so that it appears as if these latter decide how 
 far forward the beetle is to move after depositing an egg. 

I have not been able to determine the total number of eggs 
 laid by a female, the greatest number of which I have a record 
 being twenty ; neither do I know whether an individual lays all 
 her eggs during one short period or whether she lays a number 
 of batches. 

The period of oviposition for the species is a long one, lasting 
 from March until July. I have not actually found eggs later 
 than June 15th, but 1 have found very young larviB in August 
 under rather interesting circumstances. 

On August 5th, 1915, in a disused chalk pit at Beckham in 
 East Norfolk, where there were several shallow clear-water 
 ponds, I found various stages of the beetle. There were old 
 males and females, newly-emerged soft males and females, full- 
 grown larvae and a few larvae not more than ten days or a 
 fortnight old. As incubation in the warmest period of the year 
 occupies only nine days, the eggs from which these larvaj hatched 
 must have been laid in July. 

4 (b) Incubation. 

The earliest laid eggs took twenty-five days to hatch, but the 
 incubation period gradually became shorter until, in June, nine 
 or ten days became normal. Eggs laid early in April and 
 placed in an incubator at summer temperature liatched in nine 
 or ten days, so that temperature is evidently the controlling 
 factor in the length of the incubation period. I shall return to 
 this point later on. 

8o far as I can find, there is no special hatchnig appai-atus 
 sucli as that in the larva of Dyiiscits (1 ), the shell ripping from end 
 to end along an irregular line and apparently always along the 
 ventral side of the embryo, however it may happen to be lying 
 in the egg. A small pair of spines are certainly visible on the 
 head bet\veen the eyes, near the position of the hatching spines 
 of DijUscus lap2)onicios, but they are not functional, as is evident 
 from the manner in which the shell rips, and I imagine that, if 
 anything weakens the latter along the breaking line, it must be 
 the tarsal claws. 

4 (c) Vital Staining oftjie Embryo. 

In order to observe the developing embryo I removed many of 
 the eggs from the water-plants upon whicb they had been laid 
 and kept them upon cotton-wool saturated with water. I have 
 used this method with the eggs of several other water insectsâ€” 
 e.g., Agrionid dragonflies and others, Banatra linearis, and
