C/iijle intestine. — The intestine takes a practicallj^ straight 
 couvse in the axis of tlie body. The wall of the intestine is 
 annnlated on the external surface by sJiallow depressions between 
 the cells. Except for a short distance at the beginning and end 
 the whole length of the gnt-wall is deeply pigmented. The 
 rectum is an elongated and narrow canal indefinitely demarcated 
 from the intestine. 

Excretory 7)ore. — The excretory pore is placed just caudad of 
 the nerve-ring in the mid- ventral line. It is •068 ram. from the 
 head end. 

Nerve collar. — This is very thin in comparison with the size of 
 the worm. It is placed "6 mm. from the cephalic end. 

Genital organs. — Male : Tlie testis is irregularly coiled, reach- 
 ing within 5 mm. of the head. Thei"e is no distinct seminal 
 vesicle. The cement gland is of enormous length. 

Female: The wide opening, of the vulva is surrounded by a 
 raised cuticvilar margin. The strongly muscular vagina runs 
 straight towards the head end. The two uteri are convergent, 
 ending in strong ovejectors lying side by side and joining the 
 cephalic end of the vagina. The ovaries are irregularly coiled, 
 reaching within 5 mm. of the head end. 

Bursa. — The biu-sa is very short, and indistinctly divided into 
 three lobes of approximately the same length. It measures 
 •22 mm. in length and '7 mm. in brea.dth.

 Dorsal rajr of bursa. 

The ventral ray is bifid throughout its length, and is placed a 
 considerable distance from the ventral edge of the bursa. The 
 lateral rays arise by a common origin. At the site of their 
 bifurcation each ray has a bulb-like swelling. The externo- lateral 
 ray lies separate from the other two and close and parallel to the 
 ventral ray. It ends in a papilla on the external surface a short 
 distance from the edge of the biu'sa. The medio-lateral and 
 dorso-lateral rays lie close together. The externo-dorsal ray has
