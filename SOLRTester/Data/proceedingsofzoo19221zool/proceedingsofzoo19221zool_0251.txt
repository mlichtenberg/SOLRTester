A farther paper on the Common Cuckoo might well be con- 
 sidered superfluous, if it were not for the fact that an examination 
 of the literature on the subject shews that this is by no means 
 the ease ; many of the details of the bird's life-history are found 
 still to need proof, and are merely reiterated from the pages of 
 previous authors, who in place of such proof make assertions, 
 Avhich though highly probable, require confirmation. 

The eggs now exhibited have been collected during a period of 
 more than twenty years, and give sure proof of the facts 
 pointed out below. 

Those of us who saw Mr. Edgar Chance's admirable film, which 
 was shown in this room some weeks ago, and redounded equally 
 to iiis credit and that of his photographer, were initiated into 
 the ways of an individual hen Cuckoo when depositing her eggs 
 and were given a clue to the probable number of them ; while a 
 meeting of the British Ornithologists' Chib next month is to be 
 devoted to the Cuculidse as a Family : but the present paper 
 deals neither with an individual and its idiosyncracies, nor witli 
 the whole of this world-wide Family, but with a species — our 
 British Cuckoo — and its regular habits. 

It is by no means easy to examine into the bii-d's life-history, 
 but the writer ikas had unusual good luck. In the comparatively 
 small grounds of Histon Manor, near Cambridge, he and the owner, 
 Mr. W. A. Harding, found that no fewer than five hen Cuckoos 
 would lay their eggs in a single year, and that in one case the egg- 
 was so remai-kable that recognition was instantaneous. Hardly 
 less remarkable were specimens from the Cam, most of which 
 are now exhibited by kind permission of Dr. Ticehurst and 
 Mr. Bonhote, and are used to strengthen the evidence for the 
 conclusions arrived at. 

Incidentally the abundance of hens at Histon tends to discredit 
 the theory of polyandry. 

The first series of clutches passed round shews the same hen 
 laying in the nests of the Greenfinch, Spotted Flycatcher, and 
 Pied Wagtail, and proves that she does not always choose the same 
 foster parent. The egg, in this case peculiar and unmistakable, 
 bears no resemblance to the others in the nest. Such resemblance 
 is the exception rather than the rule, except where, as in the 
 case of the Meadow-Pipit, the typical Cuckoo's egg is more or 
 less similar to that of its host, whose nests are plentiful and 
 easily found. Several examples are exhibited. 

The second series affords strong corroboration ; the Cuckoo's 
 egg, though less peculiar, is in each case undoubtedly that of
