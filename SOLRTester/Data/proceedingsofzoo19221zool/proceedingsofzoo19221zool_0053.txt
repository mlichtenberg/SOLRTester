TEMPOllAL ARCHES OF TUE REPTILIA. 21 

the fossa in the Mammal-like reptiles which really corresponds to 
 the lower fossa in Sjyhenodon. Though this eai'ly view of mine 
 has been opposed by Andrews, Willistoi], Watson, and others, 
 I have never seen reason to alter it, as apart from the superficial 
 resemblance of the upperside of the skull to that of a Therapsid, 
 the fundamental structure of the Plesiosaur is so diffei-ent from 
 that of the Mamma.l-like i-eptiles that I never could agree that 
 the two groups could be at all nearly related. It is with some 
 satisfaction, therefore, that I find Versluys supporting my view, 
 that the fossa in the Plesiosaur has had quite a different origin 
 from that in the Mammal-likc' reptiles. Yersluys makes it his 
 '' Synapsider Typus II." 

Elsewhere * I am dealing at some length with the question of 
 the affinities of the Plesiosaui's, and the conclusion to which I 
 come is that they are a specialised offshoot from land-reptiles on 
 the line of descent which is leading to the Diapsids, but which 
 have not yet developed a lower temporal fossa. 

In near association with the Plesiosaurs must be placed the 
 Placodonts. They are a different specialisation sprung from 
 very similar and closely allied ancestors. There is no essential 
 difference in the temporal regions of the two groups. 

The Cheionians are by far the most aberrant and puzzling 
 group among the reptiles. Unfortunately, we know nothing of 
 the ancestry. The earliest-known fossil forms are already typical 
 Cheionians, and help us very little. Among living forms we have 
 great variations in the temporal regions. Some have the region 
 well roofed. Some have practically no roof at all, like the 
 American Terrapene. Some have a small roof very deeply 
 encroached on from below, like the Australian Water-Tortoise 
 Elseya. 

For many years I have adhered to the view, which was also 
 held by Baur, that there is some close relationship between the 
 Chelonia and the Plesiosaurs. Unfortunately, each group is so 
 extremely specialised that hardly any apparent resemblance 
 i^emains. It is like comparing a Whale and a Bat. The 
 Ohelonian and the Plesiosaur has each a remarkable type of 
 shovilder-girdle, nowhere else to be found, and each is merely a 
 modification of the same common type. It is difficult to believe 
 that this remarkable type could have been twice independently 
 evolved. The pelvis, the tarsus, and many points in the skull- 
 structure confirm the affinity. 

If we assume that the Chelonian is a second remarkable 
 specialisation from a land-type, such as gave rise to the Plesiosaurs 
 by another line, we must conclude that the ancestor of the 
 Chelonian had, like the Plesiosaur, a single temporal fossa, and 
 that the condition now met with in Cheionians has resulted from 
 the loss of the posterior ai-ch. A skull like that of Trionyx with 
 its greatly elongated supraoccipital and the squamosal perched on
