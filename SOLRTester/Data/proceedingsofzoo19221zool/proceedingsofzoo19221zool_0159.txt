long time, and many of which miisfc have died. Very numerous 
 small morulse were budding from the body-wall, to which they 
 were all, at the stage examined, adherent. Some were also 
 budding from the surface of the alimentary canal ; and here and 
 there some were seen in the angle between strands and parjetes. 
 There was no special production in the proper genital segments 
 of the parent animal. 

Sections 7 jj. thick, stained in Delafield's hsematoxylin and 
 diflt'erentiated by a short immersion in iron-alum, dispel any 
 doubts as to the actual formation of morulse on the strands ; they 
 show that sexual cells may also be produced from the lining of 
 the body-wall, as well as — which is interesting — from the newly- 
 forming ring of cellular proliferation around the site of each 
 future fission. They also allow the history of the developing 
 morulpe to be traced. 

Text-figs. 2-6, all taken from longitudinal sections, will illus- 
 trate the various situations of origin, and wi)l supply the place 
 of further description.

The early stages in the production of morulee may be shortly 
 summarized as follows : — 

(1) The sexual cells when first recognizable as such (text-fig. 2) 
 possess large, round nuclei, close together and with a diameter of 
 7/x or rather less ; a protoplasmic covering is scarcely dis- 
 tinguishable ; in the pei'iphery of the cell the chromatin is 
 scattered, but (as seen in sections) it forms a ring near the 
 middle, the centre of the ring being clear (text-fig. 2), or more
