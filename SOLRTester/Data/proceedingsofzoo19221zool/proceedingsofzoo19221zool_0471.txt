more symmetrically ai'tiodactyl. The plantar pad is wider as 
 compared with its length than in Coelogenys, and its three com- 
 ponent elements are less well defined than even in that genus, 
 and markedly less so than in Chinchilla. As in Chinchilla, the 
 carpal pad is larger than the plantar pad and closer to it than 
 in Coilogenys, but it is not so distinctly divided into two as in 
 those genera, and, as in Chinchilla, the outer side of the wrist is 
 normally hairy. 

The hind foot differs from th.at of Chinchilla and Ccdogenys in tlie 
 complete suppression of the fifth digit and of the corresponding 
 element of the plantai' pad. The second digit, moreover, is very 
 markedly shorter than the fourth *, and the latter, too, although 
 long, is shorter in comparison with the long third digit than in 
 Chinchilla and Ccdogenys. The claws of these thi-ee digits are as 
 powerful relatively as in Ccdogenys. The plantar pad, as in those 
 genera, is composed of two elements, but they are very indistinctly 
 defined, and the whole pad is three-lobed with emarginate 
 antero-lateral and posterior borders. The metatarsal pad is large 
 and horny, but undivided. A peculiarity of the foot is the 
 encroachment of the hairs of the outer side nearly up to the 
 middle line, overlapping, with those of the opposite side, the 
 area between the plantar and metatarsal pads ; and a further 
 difierence from Chinchilla is the development of a thick bunch 
 of stiff" bristles on the inner side of the third digit. Chinchilla 
 has long hair in this position, but the brush, or comb, is 
 specially developed upon the second digit. The feet of this genus 
 are interesting, because they connect those of the Chinchilline 
 with those of the typical Caviine section of the group of Rodents. 
 The hind foot is also modified on much the same lines as tha,t of 
 Dasyprocta, although the fore foot is very different. (Text- 
 fig. 14, C, D.) 

The feet of Cavia porcellus, the domesticated Guinea-pig, have 
 been figured and described by Mivart and Murie (P. Z. S. 1866, 
 pp. 383-417), and by TuUberg. In the artiodactyle fore foot the 
 pollex is suppressed and the four remaining digits are moderately 
 long and subsymmetrically arranged, the third and fourth being 
 subequal and longer than the second and fifth, which are also 
 subequal. The claws project well beyond the normally shaped 
 digital pads. The plantar pad is well defined and three-lobed, 
 the median lobe being the largest. Behind the plantar pad 
 there is a single carpal pad, separated from it by an area of 
 naked skin. The hind foot is perissodactyle, with only three 
 toes, whereof the median (the third) is the longest. The claws 
 are longer than in the fore foot. The plantar pad is moderately 
 well defined and two-lobed, the inner lobe being much smaller 
 than the outer. The metatarsal area has no large horny plate 
 representing the pads, which are merely indicated by a single
