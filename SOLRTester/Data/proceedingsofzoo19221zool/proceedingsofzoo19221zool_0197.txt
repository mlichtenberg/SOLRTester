SYMPATHETIC NERVES OF HYRAX CAPENSIS. 151 

The superior laryngeal nerve (b) is replaced by a strong cord 
 which unites with one of tlie divisions of the recurrent nerve. 
 This coxtI gives off internal laryngeal (i.l.n), two external lai-yn- 
 geal (e.l.n), two thyroid {t.y.n), and three external pharyngeal 
 (a) nerves. Small branches {v.n) accompany the common carotid 
 artery. The internal laryngeal branch enters the larynx through 
 the thyro-hyoid interval. 

The left recurrent nerve (e) is given off in the common position. 
 It encircles the aortic arch and runs a,ntero-laterally through the 
 neck. In the middle of the neck it shows a fusiform expansion 
 (E) and divides into a mesial nerve (R.L.N), which is the true 
 inferior laryngeal nerve, and a lateral cord (C) which unites with 
 the superior laryngeal nerve to form a loop, whose upper pai-t 
 has been described above. Numerous tracheal (TN) and (Esopha- 
 geal nerves (ON) are given off. They form plexuses of which the 
 tracheal one is the more superficial. And the oesophageal plexus 
 anastomoses with the oesophageal branches of the right recurrent 
 nerve (d). The latter also forixis a loop with the right superior 
 laryngeal nerve, but there is no fusiform expansion. And both 
 recurrent nerves give off cardiac branches (C.N) which are thicker 
 and more numerous on the left side. 

In some specimens these loops are absent, and there is no 
 external communication between the superior and recurrent 
 laryngeal nerves. 

The existence of anastomoses between the laryngeal nerves in 
 Man has long been known. And Landois and Stirling (2) sum- 
 marised our knowledge as follows : — " A connecting branch runs 
 from the superior laryngeal to the inferior (the anastomosis of 
 Galen), which occasionally gives off sensory branches to the upper 
 half of the trachea (sometimes to the larynx ?) ; perhaps also to 
 the oesophagus {Longet), and sensory fibres (?) for the muscles of 
 the larynx supjalied by the recurrent laryngeal. According to 
 FranQois Frank, sensory fibres pass by this anastomosis from the 
 recui'rent into the superior laryngeal. According to Waller and 
 Burckhard, the motor fibres of both laryngeal nerves are all de- 
 rived from the accessorius, while Chauveau maintains that the 
 crico-thyroid is an exception." In a recent paper Dilworth (1) 
 described and figured a well- mai^ked bi^anch running between the 
 recurrent and internal laryngeal nerves, and says: " . . . . the 
 laryngeal nerves are really a plexus of nerves. Just as the vagus 
 breaks up into its various plexus'es in the body, it does the same 
 in the larynx. It is a highly modified plexus. I would further 
 suggest tliat it ai-ose by the larynx separating a strand of fibres 
 from the vagus — that this strand is represented by the continuovKS 
 nerve joining the internal and recurrent laryngeal, and that the 
 separation from this strand of further fibres forms the various 
 nerves of the larnyx." The conditions shown in text-fig. 6 sup- 
 port Dilworth's views, and I would extend his views of the origin 
 of the laryngeal nerves from the continuous strand to account for 
 the origin of the tracheal, oesophageal, and thyroid nerves.
