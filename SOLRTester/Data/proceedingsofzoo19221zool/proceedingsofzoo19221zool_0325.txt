Source of Material. — The material consists of a single male 
 discovered accidentally amongst the type material of Pterido- 
 pharynx africana Lane, deposited in the E'atural History 
 Museum. I was enabled to examine this material throuoh the 
 kindness of Dr. Baylis. It was collected at Lawrence Hill, 
 Addo Bush, Cape Province, Africa, and was presented to 
 the Natural History Museum by the Imperial Bureau of 
 Entomology in August 19] 9. This collection had been examined 
 by Lieut, -Col. Clayton Lane, and had been separated by him 
 into two hitherto undescribed species. Careful search through 
 the whole material failed to discover further specimens of 
 A. sameera. 

Shape of body . — Body is stout in comparison with its length. 
 It is 10*5 mm. long. The greatest diameter of the body is 
 about its middle, where it is "45 mm. It tapers slightly 
 towards the head, and also towards the caudal end, just 
 anterior to the bursa, which, however, gives a truncated 
 appearance to the posterior extremity of the male.
