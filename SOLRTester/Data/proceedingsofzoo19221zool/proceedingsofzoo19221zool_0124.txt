80 ME. F. BALFOUR-BROWNE ON THE LIFE-HISTORY 

three Irish, and thirty, out of the seventy, English county and 
 vice-county divisions. 

Tiie only Scottish i-ecord, for Midlothian, occurs in Duncan's 
 Catalogue (3), where the species is described as " very scarce, 
 Pond at Coates " on the authorit}^ of Sir P. Walker. The same 
 record is repeated in the ' Entomologia Edinensis '" (17), but neither 
 Andrew Murray (9) nor Sharp (11) refers to it. 

For the North of England there are two isolated records for the 
 species, one for Northumberland South and the other for Cum- 
 berland. The former is given by Stephens (15) on the authority 
 of G. Wailes : " Once near Newcastle by Mr. Hevvitson." Bold's 
 comment that this is " probably erroneous as it has never since 
 been met with " (4) is quite valueless. The Cumberland record is 
 bare, being a note by James McDougall (8), who mentions having 
 taken the species at Wigton, and although I have made enquiries 
 I can find out nothing further about it. 

In the case of many ^species, records for localities far beyond 
 the normal range are frequently regarded as due to errors in 
 identification, but Pelohius is not a beetle likely to be confounded 
 with any other, so that, unless a mistake has been made in 
 labelling, records for this species may be regarded as correct, 
 and are pi'obably to be accounted for on the assumption that 
 individuals have, from time to time, wandered northwards. In 
 such a manner might the species extend its range, but in this 
 case the attempts to extend northward seem to have failed up to 
 the pi"esent. 

The extreme northern range limit seems to be Yorks S.E., 
 where the species is "fairly common in the stagnant pools near 
 Withei-nsea," according to H. W. Baker of Hull (4). The records 
 for Torks S.W., Lanes S., and Derby may or may not be for 
 single specimens in each case. The Torks S.W. record appears 
 in the Victoria County History (2) as " Doncaster (J. Wilcock)." 
 The Lanes, record is an old one given by W. E. Sharp (13) as 
 " Rufi'ord (Gregson)," though, for some unexplained reason, this 
 record is omitted in Sharp's later lists of 1906 (13) and 1908 (14). 

The fact that Jahn (6) mentions " two specimens in a pool near 
 Cheadle " seems to suggest that here again we are within the 
 normal range of tlie species ; and although records even south of 
 this are scarce — in many cases only one in a county or vice- 
 county, — there is little doubt but that the species is fairly 
 common in the eastern and southern parts of the country. Tlie 
 accompanying " typo-map " will give a general idea of the 
 distribution of the species, and the letters i^epresenting the 
 county and vice-county names will be sufiiciently intelligible, as 
 they are more or less in correct geographical position. 

Pelohius is scarcely to be described as established in Ireland, 
 since, in the case of both Cork Mid. (7) and Clare (7), only one 
 specimen was found, and possibly the Wicklow record, "near 
 Lara," in the Haliday MS. (5) also refers to a single specimen, I 
 have Avorked many of the Irish counties fairly thoroughly, and
