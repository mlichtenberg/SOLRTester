and hatched in incubators about April 14th. The chicks were 
 examined on April 17th, with the following results : — 

A. From the pile parents there were 16 chicks, 13 of which 

were yellow without spots. The other three were coloured. 

(1) Bluish primaries and rump, reddish back, sides and belly 

yellow. 

(2) Smoky black on head and back, and on wing-primaries. 

(3) Smoky black on back and head. 

B. From the pale pile cock with white hens there were 19 chicks : 

of these 11 had yellow down apparently without colour, 
 and 8, including one that died after hatching, had some 
 colour. Of these 8, four had one or two black spots and 
 four had more continuous colour, the darkest being the 
 dead one, which was dai'k smoky black over the head and 
 the wdiole of the back and wings. 

The other three were as follows : — 

(1) Slightly greenish on rumji. 

(2) Slightly bluish rnmp, head ditto, otherwise yellow. 

(3) Back dark reddish combined with blackish colour, slight 

black spot on head. 

If we consider these lots separately, the theoretical expectation, 
 on the supposition that the black-red colour of the original male 
 parent was a single character, would be one-fourth black-red in F^, 
 the black-red being recessive. Thus in the chicks from Pen A', 
 16 in number, there should have been 4 coloured: the actual 
 number wa,s 3. Of the chicks from Pen B, 19 in number, one- 
 fourth would be between 4 and 5, or vei-y nearly 5. The actual 
 number was 4 if we include only those which had more or less 
 continiious colour. If we take the two lots together, all the Fj's 
 being heterozygote, the number of coloured recessives was 7 out 
 of 35. It would l)e expected, however, that black-red recessive 
 chicks in the down would be brown with black stripes, like the 
 black-red dominants in my cross between bankiva and Silky. 
 There were none at all like this. 

On October 9th I made a careful examination of these birds of 
 the F., generation, which were then in mature plumage, and their 
 characters were : — 

A. From pile parents. 

7 Cocks, all showing the pile coloration, but with different 
 degrees of intensity in the colour on the back, ranging from pale 
 yellow to red. 

1 . Deeply coloured pile ; legs yellow. A photograph of the 

skin of this bird is shown in PI. I. fig. 1. 

2. Similar but not so deep a colour ; legs yellow.
