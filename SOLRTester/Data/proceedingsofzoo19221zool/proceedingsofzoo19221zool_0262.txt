206 DR. M. KHALIL ON THE NEMATODE 

Thei'e is some confusion regarding the correct zoological 
 terminology of the species of elephants. For this reason the 
 term.s African and Indian are used thioughout this work. 

NEMATHELMINTHES. 

Class NEMATODA. 

Super-family Rhabdiasoidea Kailliet, 1916. 

Family A T R A T i D .E Travassos, 1919. 

This family name was given by Travassos to include the 
 following genera : — Atractis, Ozolaimtos, liodonia, Labiduris, 
 Crossocephcdus, Macracis, Cobboldina, and Cyrtosoormm, to which 
 I add the genus Leiperenia. 

Travassos' diagnosis of the family runs as follows : — CEsophagus 
 with an anterior and a posterior bulb ; viviparous, the female 
 genital system is generally single ; vulva is placed posteriorly or 
 in common with the anus ; parasites of vertebrates. 

Genus Leiperenia Khalil, 1922. 

Small nematodes just visible to the naked eye. The males are 
 slightly smaller than the females. Mouth is surrounded by moi'e 
 than six lips. CEsophagus is divided into an anterior, short, and 
 strongly muscular portion, to which the name pharynx is given. 
 The posterior portion of the a\sophagus is about three times as 
 long as the pharynx. The anterior end of the body is provided 
 with a cuticular membranous expansion on either side. There 
 is a large excretory' vesicle. The excretoi-y pore is raised on a 
 papilla which is striated radially. 

Male : The caudal extremity of the male is curved. There are 
 two unequal spicules and an accessory piece. There are four 
 papillse on the tail. 

Female : Viviparous, and the embryos reach an advanced 
 stage of development in uiero. The vulva is placed in the 
 posterior part of the body, separate, and a short distance in 
 fi^ont of the anus. 

Type-species, Leiperenia leiperi (from the African elephant). 

Leiperenia leiperi Khalil, 1922. (Text-figs. 1-4.) 

Material. — The material consists of two males and three 
 females, taken from Prof. Leiper's collection of Elephant 
 nematode parasites. 

Shape of body. — These nematodes are very small and just 
 visible to the naked eye. The males are 3-8 mm. long. The 
 females are slightly longer, being 3*9 mm. in length. The 
 maximum diameter of the body is about the middle: it is "2 mm. 
 in the male and '21 mm. in the female. The body narrows 
 slightly as it is traced towards the head end, which is truncated
