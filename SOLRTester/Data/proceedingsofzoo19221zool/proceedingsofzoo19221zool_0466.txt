but exceeds it in length, although much shorter than the third. 
 The third and fourth are long, thick, and subequal. The ftfth 
 only reaches the distal end of the first phalange of the fourth. 
 The ends of the digits are thick and bluntly rounded, and 
 furnished with nail-lilie claws, which are concealed from the 
 inferior aspect. The sole is marked with a Y-shaped groove, 
 the branches of which run to the margin at the spaces between 
 the second and third and fourth and fifth digits, the upright

presumably marking the original line between the two elements 
 of the carpal pad. The hind foot has the sole short, only a little 
 longer than in Ctenomys, and, as in that genus, broad in front 
 and narrowed behind. The second, third, fourth, and fifth digits 
 bear much the same relation to each other in length as those of 
 the fore foot, but the hallux is well develo^jed as compared with 
 the pollex and stands well away from the sole. The nails are as 
 in the fore foot, except that on the second digit the nail is claw- 
 like, according to Winge, and projects beyond the tip of the 
 digit, acting, no doubt, as a scratcher.
