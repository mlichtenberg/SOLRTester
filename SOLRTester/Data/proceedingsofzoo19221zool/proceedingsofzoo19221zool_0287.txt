19-21 mm. long. The maximum diameter of the body is about 
 the middle. It is -62 mm. in the male and -78 in the female. 

The average length of this species given here is greater than 
 that original]}^ recorded. Gedoelst stated that the length of the 
 male is 12-8 mm. and the female 17-8 mm. That these measure- 
 ments were based on a single individual male and one female is 
 evident from his remarks : " L'unique exemplaire que nous avons 
 etudie mesurait, etc." The measurements recorded here are the 
 average of all the specimens available.
