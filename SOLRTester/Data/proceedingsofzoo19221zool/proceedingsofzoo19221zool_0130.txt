86 MR. F. BALFOUR-BROWNE ON THE LIFE-HISTORY 

various water-beetles both Hydradephaga and Hydropliilidse ; and 
 as a rule they do very well, but occasionally an egg shows signs 
 of being xmhealthy, that is, the surface becomes the home of 
 numljers of minute Protozoa and Algae. Such an egg if left to 
 itself invariably dies, but I discovered a way of treating it which 
 usually saved it, and this was by saturating the cotton-wool with 
 a solution of methylene blue. Any moderate strength seemed to 
 be suitable, and the methylene blue killed off the Protozoa or Aigse 
 without injuring the egg. But the efiect of the methylene blue 
 was not confined to destroj'ing the Protozoa and Alga) on the 
 egg-shell. It did not in a,ny way injuriously affect the develof)ing 
 embryo, but certain parts of the living tissues took up the stain 
 and stood out bright blue. The staining varied with different 
 individuals, with the same individual at different times and 
 possibly also with different strengths of methylene blue, but in all 
 cases the embryonic appendages of the first abdominal segment, 
 which are well developed in this species just as they are in 
 Dyiiscus lappcnicits, took up the stain {v. PI. I. figs. 9, 10, & 11). 

Otherwise the staining was very irregular. In the case of one 
 larva just ready to hatch, the dorsal phar3'ngeal muscles and the â€¢ 
 malpighian tubules were stained, and on the left side of each 
 thoracic segment and of the first two abdominal segments a short 
 line, curved in the thoracic, straight in the abdominal segments, 
 was also stained. At one end this line came to the surface of the 
 embryo and suggested a spiracle, although there is no pro-thoiacic 
 spiracle in the larva and the spots were above the real meso- and 
 meta-thoracic spiracles which were also stained. Incidentally it 
 may be mentioned here that none of the spiracles are functional 
 in the larva. In the abdomen of this specimen parts of the 
 dorsal longitudinal muscle system under the terga were stained, 
 but not evenly, certain strands having taken the stain, others 
 not having taken it. In the alimentary canal was some greenish 
 fluid which I took to be methylene blue changed by the action of 
 the secretions. 

I give this example merely to show the strange effect of 
 methylene blue, and without making any attempt to explain it, 
 I assume that the parts which stain are in some wa}^ active at the 
 time they stain. For instance, possibly the one-sided staining 
 of the dorsal longitudinal muscle system in the specimen referred 
 to may have indicated that those muscle-strands were doing work 
 while the corresponding strands upon the other side were doing 
 none. If this suggestion is sound it might perhaps be possible, 
 by watching any embryo develop in an egg kept in methylene 
 blue, to recognize various parts functioning at different times. 

The staining of the first abdominal appendages, which disappear 
 after hatching, is also of some interest if this suggestion is correct. 
 These appendages first appear when the embryo is about three 
 days old and after the three pairs of thoracic appendages, but 
 they are more distinct than any of the following abdominal 
 appendages which rapidly disappear, and they persist, as more
