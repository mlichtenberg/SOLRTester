Head glands. — There are four elongated, deeply pigmented 
 bodies surrounding the beginning of the oesophagus. They con- 
 tain orange-coloured granules, suggesting their being glandular. 
 Their anterior end is elongated in the foi-m of a duct lying 1o the 
 outer side of the chitinous ring of the mouth capsule. Their 
 exact termination could not be made out, but probably they 
 traverse the submedian head papillae and open at their tip. The 
 presence of ducts opening on the tip of the head papillpe was first 
 recorded by Cooper Curtice and confirmed by Giles in (Esophago- 
 stovm.m columhianum. 

Both these observers, however, interpreted fhem to be the ducts 
 of the lateral canals. Looss' comment was : " I do not entertain 
 the slightest doubt th.at they have seen the outlet of the head- 
 glands."

 Female tail. 

Nerve collar. — The thick nerve collar is -25 mm. from the head 
 end. 

Genital organs. — The naale testes are irregularly convoluted, 
 i-eaching to within 3 mm. of the head. The cement gland is long, 
 terminating at the base of the genital cone, whei'e the ejaculatory 
 duct opens into the cloaca. 

The female vagina is a long, straight canal lying in the axis of 
 the body. At its cephalic end the two strongly muscular ovejectors 
 open into it, connecting it with the corresponding uterus. The 
 convolutions of the ovaries reach to within 4*5 mm. of the cephalic 
 end of the body.
