a long, limp stalk; total length 5 cm., of which 1-5 is poly- 
 parium. 

2. Branching. The lowest branches show only hints of being 
 foliaceou^. 

3. Oolou7\ A fine coral-red in stalk, Text-fig. 18. 
 supporting bundle, polyp stalk, and ten- 
 tacles ; the general cortex of the poly- 
 parium is white flushed with red, and 
 the anthocodial spicules are white. 

4. Polyp stalks long. 

5. Polyps in divergent groups of 4-10. 

6. Polyp spicules. The armature of 
 the anthocodise consists of 8 pomts of 
 small spicules, very compactly disposed, 
 6-8 en chevron in each point ; the upper- 
 most pair in each row predominate and 
 may project slightly. 

Tlie supporting bundle is strongly B. microspiculata Piitter 
 developed, and one strong central 

spindle projects for 1 mm. ; the spicules here are thickly but 
 finely spinose. 

7. Other spicules. The tentacles show a double dorsal row of 
 transversely disposed, narrow, jagged, reddish spicules ; the cortex 
 of the sterile stalk has thick spindles, usually bent, covered with 
 large warts, often compound. Along with these are smaller bent 
 spindles, often with large prongs on the convex side. There ai'e 
 also numerous bright I'ed iri-egularly quadrangular or knob-like 
 corpuscles, which may be vaguely called '' stars." These are 
 well figured by Piitter. All these stalk spicules with prongs are 
 suited for interlocking. 

Perhaps the most characteristic features are (1) the numerous 
 compact chevron pairs of the anthocodial points, and (2) the 
 quadrangular " stars." 

Locality : — Station 315. 

12. Dendronephthya orientalis (Hend.). 

Described by Henderson in ' Alcyonarians of the Indian 
 Ocean,' Part II. pp. 30-32 (1909). 

Diagnosis: — Divaricate; no regular outline; somewhat flat- 
 tened ; polyps in loose clusters ; polyp stalks long ; supporting 
 bundle strong ; point spicules 1 pair only, of which one member 
 is the larger and markedly projects ; crown of 3 loose horizontal 
 rows : grade VI. ; spicules : tentacles conspicuously armoured, 
 in the cortex very conspicuous strong spindles and numerous 
 small warty triradiates and multiradiates ; colou]" : general surface 
 wliite, anthocodial and supporting-bundle spicules pink. 

Anthocodial Grade and Formula : — 

YI. = 1 P -t- 3 Or + strong S.B.
