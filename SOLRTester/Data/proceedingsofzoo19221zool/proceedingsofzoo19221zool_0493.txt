ill spirit-preserved material. In a male of Coendu novce-hisjxinice, 
 however, in which the anus opens near the centre of a very 
 large naked area, without integumental ridges, and with the 
 penis at its lower extremity, there appeared to be a median 
 longitudinal mass of glandular tissue, without definite orifice, 
 showing through the skin of the longish perineal area between 
 the anus and the penis. Possibly this represents the coalesced and 
 partially aborted paired glands oi Hi/strix. (Text-figs. 20, G. H ; 
 26, G. F.) 

In 2Iyocastor the anus, with a few hairs i-ound the orifice, 
 forms a pi-ojection in the centre of a naked area a little distance 
 below the root of the tail. In the female this naked area is 
 continued round the genito-ui-inary region ; but in the male the 
 long perineal area is hairy. The anal glands in both sexes form 
 a solid median mass, opening by four pairs of small papillate 
 orifices into a sac which can be extruded by evagination just 
 beneath the anus. (Text-figs. 21, F-H ; 27, A, B.) 

In Capromys the anus is on an eminence a little way below 
 the base of the tail in the upper half of a naked area of skin 
 which extends downwards to the prepuce of the penis or clitoris. 
 When it is dilated the single orifice of the anal gland may be 
 seen immediately beneath it within the sphincter. This orifice 
 leads into a small pocket filled with the secretion of the gland 
 which lies mainly behind the pocket. The gland seems to resemble 
 in all respects that of Octodon, and differs from that of 2fyocastor 
 in being much smaller, apparently unprovided with papillae and 
 also incapable of evagination. (Text-figs. 21, A; 27, C, D.) 

In Octodon the anus also opens on a prominence a little way 
 below the base of the tail and about the same distance above the 
 prepuce in both sexes, the pei'ineal region and the area round 
 the prepuce being naked. The anal gland is a median mass with 
 a small sac opening just beneath the anus by a median orifice, 
 but concealed from view unless the latter is distended. (Text- 
 figs. 22, B, C; 27, E.) 

In Ctenom.ys the anus is more dilated than in Octodon, and its 
 walls inside are symmetrically wrinkled ; but in the single male 
 example examined I was unable to satisfy myself as to the 
 presence of a gland such as is seen in Octodon. According to 
 Tallberg, however, a gland similar in position and structure 
 to that of Octodon is found in C'tenomys, Echimys, Xelomys, 
 Cannabateomys, and Abrocoina. (Text-fig. 22, E, D.) 

In Lagostomus the anus lies just beneath a haiiy excrescence 
 some distance below the root of the tail. Just within the 
 sphincter may be seen the apertures of the anal glands opening 
 just below the orifice. From each side of the subcircular anus 
 a ridge of skin runs downwards, forwards, and obliquely inwards 
 to meet its fellow of the opposite side in a point, the two 
 forming the lateral margins of an acutely angled glandular area 
 covered with short hair. (Text-fig. 25, E. F.) 

In Chinchilla the anus also forms a marked projection some
