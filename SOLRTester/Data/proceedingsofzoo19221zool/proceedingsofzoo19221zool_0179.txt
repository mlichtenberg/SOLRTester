(1) The Testis Sacs of the Oligochceta. ■ 

The primitive condition of the male organs of the Oligochseta 
 is that seen in most of the lower families as well as in many 
 Megascolecidfe and Lnmbricidse. The testes are attached to the 
 anterior wall of their segment,, the funnels to the posterior ; the 
 sperm cells are shed into the C(jelomic cavity at an early stage of 
 their development, and ripen in the general cavity of the 
 segment, or more usually in csecal sacs, the seminal vesicles, 
 formed by bulgings of the septa (text-fig. 7). In this case there 
 are no testis sacs.

Not infrequently, however, it happens that the lower part of 
 the segment, where the testes and' funnels lie, is cut off by a 
 partition from the rest of the cavity of the segment. The

organs are then contained in special compartments of the ccelom,
