Shape ofhody. — lu the preserved condition the body of both 
 males and females is practically straight. The male is 14-15 mm. 
 long. The female is slightly longer, being on an average 
 16-5-17 mm. The greatest diameter of the body is about the 
 middle, being -46 mm. in the male and -65 mm. in the female. 
 The body tapers slightly towards the head end and the caudal 
 end. In the female the tail becomes suddenly constricted from the 
 body, appearing to the naked eye as a spinous process projecting 
 from the posterior end of the body. 

Skin. — The skin is finely striated throughout the whole length 
 of the body, including the tail of the female. The strlations are 
 regularly placed at distances of 10 /x between. There is no 
 cuticular expansion. 

Mouth collar. — The mouth collar hns a rounded outline. It is 
 separated from the rest of the body by a distinct groove. The 
 diameter of this collar is shorter than that of the body in its

 their ba,se and sharp at their termination. The outline of the 
 tips of these leaflets, seen from the ventral aspect, forms a crescent, 
 being longer in the centre than at either side. 

Head pajnllce. — The four submedian head papillae are long, and 
 each surmounted with a smallknob. The latter is apparently 
 continuous with a core inside the papilla,, and presumablj^ 
 represents the duct of a head gland. ^ The two lateral papillae 
 do not project above the surface ; their terminations are marked 
 by a depression in the cuticle.
