AND SOME ANLELOPES OF ANGOLA. 327 

a Duiker with the usual characters of grimmi. In one detail 
 only are the above at variance with Neumann's description. He 
 states that his Antelope was smaller than average grimmi. 
 Avhereas the writer, who saw many of them in the open forest 
 between the Quanza and Luando, considers that tlie}^ were above 
 the average size for this species. But the animal which he 
 described was a menagerie specimen, and therefore unlikely to 
 have attained a perfect development. 

They a,re as richly and strikingly coloured as are the Oribi and 
 the Great Sable Antelope that inhabit the same country. 

A foetus and a young female a few weeks old are greyer and 
 more grizzled in colour, resembling the northern I'ace ahyssinicus, 
 and show no traces of the white markings of the adults. 

Part II. 

Between Benguela and Mossamedes lies a wild desert region of 
 rock, sand, and thoi'n-scrub, almost waterless and uninhabited 
 save for the presence of nomad Baquando, half negroid, half bush- 
 men, who roam over the country with their herds of goats, and a

There is a deserted sugar factory at Equimina, its spacious and 
 not unimposing facade rising above a close-set tangle of tropical 
 bush and old OA'ergrown gai-dens, near the middle of a wide and 
 pleasant bay, one of the few places along this coast possessing a 
 supply of good fresh water. At one time the site of a prosperous 
 plantation employing considerable native labour, the place has 
 now shrunk to a small untidy village harbouring an uncouth 
 assortment of beach-combing blacks and two or three Portuguese 
 fishermen. 

In the next bay to the south, called Elephant Bay, distant 
 60 miles from Benguela, a whaling station has been established 
 by a Norwegian company. 

Mr. Tyler Thompson, an Englishman well known in Angola, 
 has been in sole charge of this whaling station during the war, 
 and it was here that I landed at midnight on December 20th, 
 1918, after four consecutive days and nights spent in an open 
 fishing boat, tacking up against contrary winds from Benguela . It 
 was some relief to disembark on the threshold of an Englishman 
 in this otherwise inhospitable wilderness. 

Mr. Thompson, being an old elephant hunter with an intimate 
 knowledge of the game of the country, was able to give me much 
 valuable help and information, and I am indebted to him for the 
 success of my hunting excursions in this difficult country. A 
 supply of good water in small barrels, and fresh fruit and
