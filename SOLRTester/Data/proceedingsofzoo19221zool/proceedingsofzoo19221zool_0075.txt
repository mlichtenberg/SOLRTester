III. The Uinbellatce are characterized by : — 

(a) the umbel-like or sometimes corymb-like aggregates formed 

by the terminal twigs, the heads of the umbels beino- 
 bundles of polyps ; ^ 

(b) the disposition of all or most of the polyp heads on the 

surface of the colony.

A typical Umbellate. 

Thus the Umbellatas differ fi^om the Glomerata?, and agree with 
 the Divaricatse iu showing much minor branching. They differ 
 from the Divaricate in the presence of umbels or corymbs of 
 polyp bundles and in the entirely superficial arrangement of 
 the polyp heads. As this continuous superficial disposition 
 is obviously advantageous — giving all the polyps equal expo- 
 sure for nutritive and respiratory purposes — we may regaxxl 
 the Umbellatae as the latest expression of the evolution of the 
 Dendronephthi/a polypariura. Moreover, some Umbellatae pass 
 through a Divaricate stage. 

Of minor importance is the question whether or not the umbels 
 combine into large secondary bunches rising like hillocks on the 
 surface of the polyparium. Nor can I attach more than slight 
 importance to the shape of the polyparium whether flattened or 
 quite symmetrical, whether spherical or disc-like, and so on, for 
 these features j^robably depend to a large extent on local environ- 
 mental conditions. 

It may be noted that a large and veiy handsome colony of 
 jD. annectens was, as a whole, strikingly divaricate at first sight, 
 but a closer inspection soon showed that it was an Umbellate 
 having the terminal twigs massed into distinct umbels. (See 
 Plate III.)
