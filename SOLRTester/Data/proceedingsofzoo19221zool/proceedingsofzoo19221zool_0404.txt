332 Mil. G. BLAINE ON THE ZEBRAS 

Mossauiedes is composed of their joivied-up tracks. These Zebras 
 do not run in large herds, eight being an average number in a 
 herd. They graze in tlie mornings and afternoons on the tufted 
 grass tliat grows on the plains and on the lower slopes of the hills, 
 sheltering from the sun during the heat of the day under thorn- 
 bushes, where they doze away the mid-day hours. They are not 
 very watchful, nor does there appear to be a sentry in a herd, but 
 when alarmed, they make oft' at once, and, unlike the Bonte 
 Quagga, do not stop to look back until they have gone a long 
 distance. They then retire up one of their numerous paths in 
 single file, and then disappear over the sky-line into another part 
 of the country, Dviring the night they make their way towards 
 the coast to drink at one of the rock-pools of brackish water in 
 the lower reaches of some damba. 

Mr. Tyler Thompson has described to me how, when first he 
 vi^ent to Elephant Bay, the Zebras used nightly to drink at the 
 fresh-water pool under the clifi". Led by an old stallion, the herd 
 would come down at a gallop and halt just short of the water on 
 the plain, wliile he would continue his career up the side of the 
 cliS" to take his stand upon some point of vantage overlooking the 
 water. Having satisfied himself that no danger was present, he 
 would signal " all clear" with a low neigh, when the herd would 
 go down to the water. While they were drinking he would 
 remain at his post, and descend to drink himself when they had 
 all retired. No doubt this precaution was necessary, as lions had 
 often been known to visit the bay at night. It is curious that 
 most of the fresh water in this country is found at or near 
 sea-level, and the water in the da,mbas, where it approaches 
 the surface, may be fresh on one side and brackish on the 
 other. 

During the season of light rains when I was hunting in these 
 parts, herds of the local race of Bonte Quagga (Eqtivs quagga 
 antiquorum) came down from the interior for the fine grass, and 
 were often seen on the same plain with herds of Equus zebra 
 hartmanvm, but never associating together. The latter do not 
 go about in large herds, from six to tw^elve being the ususl number, 
 thoxigh as many as twenty have been seen together, which is 
 unusual. Old stallions are often solitary. 

Even at a distance the two species appear quite rlifierent ; for 
 whereas the Bonte Quagga is a conspicuous and by no means 
 harmonious object, looking black or smoky grey against the 
 prevailing tone of the country, this Zebra * never appears dark in 
 any position in relation to the light, but always either white, pale 
 grey, or reddish-sand colour. When standing against a back- 
 ground of rocks of which the prevailing tones are various shades 
 of warm grey, the outline melts away and the whole animal looks 
 transparent, the stripes dissolving into pale shadows. 

* In a shot specimen of Equns hartmanncB the ground-colour of the dorsal suvfate 
 was noticed to be exactlj' the same shade of pale reddish ochre as the sand on which 
 it was lying.
