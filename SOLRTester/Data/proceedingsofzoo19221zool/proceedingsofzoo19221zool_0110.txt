recesses of tlie polyparium there lay a large Opbiuroid, with its 
 arms extending in different directions and raising puzzling ques- 
 tions as to entrance and exit ; for the whole surface of the 
 polyparium is like a thick-set hedge without any gaps. 
 Locality: — Station 164. 

Still another colony, at first sight divergent, agrees so 
 thoroughly in anthocodial architecture and spiculation that 
 separation appears to me impossible. The somewhat looser 
 group of umbels show a marked tendency to grouping in hemi- 
 spherical bunches, especially on one side of the colony ; the 
 contour is somewhat broken up ; the lowest blanches are slightly 
 foliaceous ; the sterile stalk has been broken off, leaving only a 
 short stump ; the general colouring is yellow-white, with white 
 spindles in the polyps and faint rose tips to many of the sup- 
 porting bundles. Yet an examination of the anthocodiae shows 
 the characteristic composition of the points, about 7 pairs of 
 converging spicules, of which the uppermost pair may be slightly 
 larger but do not project. Again, the lower cortex contains 
 massive spindles with high compound warts, a few massive 
 triradiates, many rough spindles curved at one end like a simple 
 bugle, many pseudo-clubs, and very numerous small knobbed and 
 bossed forms like astrospheres. In the canal-wall there are among 
 rough types a number of characteristic, almost smooth, delicate, 
 flat triradiates, quadriradiates, and approximate stars. 

Deduction : — We have here another illustration of the 
 inadvisability of attaching much importance to the vegetative 
 characters. 

In anthocodial architecture this species comes near B. florida, 
 but the shortness of the polyp stalks is too emphatic to be 
 neglected.

20. Dendroneplithya annectens (sp. n.). (Plate III.) 
 Diagnosis : — Umbellate ; muph branched, but few large 
 branches ; distinctly flattened ; contour not uniform ; basal 
 branches foliaceous; polyps in small bundles of 7-12; polyp 
 stalks very short ; supporting bundle very weak ; point spicules 
 about 8 pairs, equal in size ; crown absent ; grade II. ; spicules : 
 short sterile stalk has irregularly branched, almost stellate, 
 bodies; spindles of the branches often ver}^ lai-ge (6mm.); 
 colourless spindles in the general cortex and stars at the base ; 
 colour : exposed areas on the branches white ; twigs have large 
 orange and crimson spindles, supporting bundles either orange or 
 crimson, pol3'p spicules white. 

Anthocodial Grade and Formula : — 
 11. = 8 p -1- Or -I- very weak S.B.
