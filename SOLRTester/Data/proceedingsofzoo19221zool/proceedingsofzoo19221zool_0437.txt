As little has been written on the habits of this group of 
 Crustaceans, the following observations on nine specimens from 
 the River Gambia, although made under the artificial conditions 
 of the Caird House for Insects, appeared worth recording. 

Sight. — The eyes on their pedicels only partly fill the large 
 sockets. They function ineffectually in daylight, when the crab 
 appears to rely for guidance solely on the setae with which the 
 whole body is amply provided ; but in twilight the crab is able to 
 focus on a point with tolerable accuracy. 

The third pair of maxillipeds are lined at the apex with veiy 
 soft hairs which are kept moistened ; this organ is supposed to 
 cleanse the eyes from particles of grit etc., but is also used directly 
 they are exposed to a strong light. Miss Rathbun * mentions, in 
 reference to this species, that direct exposure to the sun is fatal to 
 them. This, of course, refers to the tropical sun of West Africa. 
 When taken out into the sunlight from the subdued light of the 
 Caird House in July the crabs used their maxillipeds with great 
 energy during the first quarter of an hour, they then submei-ged 
 in a tank of water — doubtless to moisten the respiratory surface 
 of the branchial cavity — and afterwards seemed indifierent to the 
 light, although exposed to it for more than an hour. Nor could 
 thev be induced to use their maxillipeds again on that occasion, 
 even when the eyes were purposely sprinkled with water and Avith 
 dust. 

An experiment with flashlight was carried out in the Caird 
 House. The crab which was exposed to the sudden strong light 
 was sitting in the water in front of the bay, but left the tank 
 with unusual speed and precipitated himself to the far end of the 
 bay, where he assiduously brushed his eyes with both maxillipeds 
 at once for several minutes. Later he was brought back for a 
 repetition of the same experiment ; he submerged at once in the 
 tank, and remained below water with only the eyes showing until 
 the flash when he scrambled out and repeated the former 
 manceuvres precisely. The sudden transition from a dim to a 
 very strong light appeared to occasion him real distress ; but the 
 switching on of the electric lights in the bay after dark, though 
 it will arrest the crabs' movements temporarily, does not 
 necessitate the use of the maxillipeds.
