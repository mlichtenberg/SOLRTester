anteriorly, becoming a single series laterally, conical or com- 
 pressed, nuicLispid, or outer mostly bicuspid and inner tricuspid. 

Afiica and Syi'ia. 

All the species described below are peculiar to L. Victoria and 
 the Victoria, Nile. Haplocli.romis ohliq widens, the type species, 
 has a dentition unlike that of most of the species which have 
 been placed in this genus, but the discoveiy of a species in 
 L. Kivu (H. astatodon) some individuals of which have a typical 
 CtenoGhromis dentition, whilst others approximate to H. ohli- 
 qioidens, makes it possible to regard this difference as only sub- 
 generic and to still include species with conical or cuspidate 
 teeth in Haplochromis.
