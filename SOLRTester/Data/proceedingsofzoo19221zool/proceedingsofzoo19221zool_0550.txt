474 DR. J. WATERSTON ON A NEW 

Xo lai'VOD or pupai'ia were found on the flying-foxes. Newly 
 emerged adult specimens, kept in cloth bags with leaves, died 
 nfter 48 hours and never assumed the full coloration. When 
 placed on the skin of a rabbit they made feeble attempts ns if to 
 teed, but desisted after a short time, [llodliain and Bequaert 
 found that specimens newly-emerged from puparia cannot survive 
 more thiui 48 hours unless they find a host ; and that examples 
 removed from their host- bats could not be induced to feed and 
 very soon died.] 

Two examples of a hymenopterous hyperparasite issued, one 
 from each of two puparia. In emerging they made a rather 
 jagged-edged hole in the dorsal surface of the puparium. They 
 nre described below by Dr. "VVaterston. 

III. A NEW Eapelmus {E. urichi, sp. n.) from San ThomiS : 
 by James Waterston. 

(Offered for publication by permission of the Trustees of tlie British Museum.) 
 The species now described might well, owing to its antennal 
 and thoracic peculiarities, be made the type of a new genus. I 
 do not propose to take this step however, partly because it is not 
 3'-et clear how far the coalescence of funicular joints can be relied 
 upon for systematic purposes, but chiefly because only one sex is 
 at present av'ailable for study. 

It should be noted in connection with the colour characters 
 given below, that the specimens studied had been in alcohol for 
 some time before mounting. It is likely that they now appear 
 to be somewhat duller than in life. 

Eupelmus urichi, sp. n. 

S . A blackish-brown to nearly black s^Decies with the follow^- 
 ing parts more or less pale ferruginous : scape (except at tip), 
 mandibles (dental apices dark), all trochanters, knees of fore and 
 mid legs and tibial apices of the same, and tarsi except for the 
 5th joint in fore and 4th and 5th of mid and hind legs which 
 are more or less infuscated. Metallic lusti-e, only distinctly 
 showing on propodeon and dorsum of abdomen, reflections on 
 head and thorax faintly ^neous, more distinctly purplish green 
 on propodeon and base of abdomen. 

The wings, especially the fore pair on distal half, are distinctly 
 infumated, with the veins still darker. 

Head (15 : 13) : mouth opening half as broad as head ; the eyes 
 are bare and occupy two-thirds of the depth. At their neai'est 
 separated by five-twelfths of the breadth. Toruli just above the 
 base line of the eyes. The shallow sti-aight- edged clypeal emargi- 
 nation is in length sixbequal to the distance between the toruli. 
 Except in the scapal grooves, the entire frons and face have a 
 moderately fine distinctly raised sculpture, the sui'face being dull, 
 with very numerous short, stiff bristles, of which two (1:1) above 
 the corners of the clypeal emargination are longer.
