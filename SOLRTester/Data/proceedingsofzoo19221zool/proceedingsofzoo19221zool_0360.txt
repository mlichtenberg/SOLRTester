The cepbalothoiax is narrow in front, about one-third of its 
 greatest width. The mandibles are longer than the clypeus 
 is Avide ; fangs short and stout ; two equal-sized teeth and one 
 very minute on inner falx-sheath. 

The ej'esof the front row ai'e procurved, the laterals two-thirds 
 the diameter of the median and that distance apart. The eyes 
 of the second row have a diameter three times that of the front 
 median, and stand out rather prcmii:ient]y on black rims ; they 
 are as far apart as the diameter inside the black rims. The 
 rear eyes are two-thirds in diameter those of the second row, 
 two of their diameters apart and the ^ame distance from the 
 second row. 

The lip is much brcader than long, about one-third the height 
 of the maxillfe.

The abdomen is oval ; the upper surface smooth, with only a 
 few scattered fine hairs, but they cover entirely the under side. 

The epigyne consists of an oval transverse base, from Avhich 
 springs the median rib. This dividing at the apex encircles 
 hollows — one on each side — and returns to the middle in a small 
 shiny jorotuberance. Upright oval bosses stand one at each side 
 of the base.
