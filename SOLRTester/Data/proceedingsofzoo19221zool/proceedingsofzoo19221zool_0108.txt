70 DR. AV. RAE SHERRIFFS ON EVOLUTION 

This supporting bundle is veiy strong, and one sj^indle over 
 3 mm. in lengtli projects for a. distance of a little over 1 mm. 
 beyond the polyp head ; it is flanked basally on each side by 
 one or more almost equally strong, and lateral to these are smaller 
 spicules. All the spicules of the supporting bundle are strong 
 purplish red. 

One specimen showed frequently the occurrence of one project- 
 ing spicule at the tip of the points, or of two spicules markedly 
 unequal. A search revealed, however, especially in the collar 
 region, the typicallj^ equal pair characteristic of the species. 

7. Other spicules. The cortex of the stem shows stout, thick 
 spindles with strong tubercles, many markedly compound, trun- 
 cated, and along with these there are triradiates and quadri- 
 radiates besides smaller exceedingly irregular warty bodies, often 
 like the broken heads of clubs. 

LocALTTY : — Station not marked. 

19. Dendronephthya brevirama (Burchardt). 

Described by Burchardt in 'Alcyonaceen von Thursday-Island 
 und von Amboina' in Semon, Forschungsreisen,V. 5 ; pp. 438-439 
 (1898). 

Diagnosis : — Umbellate ; umbels nob combining in hemi- 
 spherical masses; contour almost continuous; flattened in one 
 plane ; surface of the individual umbels varies from convex to 
 concave ; lowest branches slightly foliaceous and form an inter- 
 rupted collar; polyps in small bundles; polyp stalks short; 
 supporting bundle strong ; point spicules 6-8 : converging pairs of 
 small spicules, none projecting; no crown; grade II. ; spicules: 
 cortex of branches shows long bright red spindles spinulose, cortex 
 of stalk has coarsely tuberculate broad spindles, triradiates, and 
 irregular discs: colour: general surface yellow-white, polyps 
 yellow, branches with strong purplish spiculation. 

Anthocodial Grade and Formula : — 
 II. = 6-8 p -J- Or + strong S.B. 
 Descriptive Notes : — 

1. Colony as a lahole. Six colonies, of which the largest measui'ed 
 19 cm. in height hj 13 cm, in width. The umbels do not combine 
 in hemispherical masses; the contour of the polyparium is almost 
 continuous; there is a considerable flattening in one plane; the 
 surface of the individual umbels varies from convex to concave — 
 a point to which I cannot attach importance. The specimen 
 should be referred to Kiikenthal's jiorida group and therein to 
 within the species B. hrevirmna. 

2. Branching. The lowest branches are slightly foliaceoiis, and 
 form an interrupted collar. 

3. Colouring. The general surface is yellow-white, the poly])B 
 yellow, the branches showing strong purplish spiculation.
