prevents the dark striping of the chicks, though it does not 
 prevent the occurrence of spots and specks of l>lack or red. On 
 the other hand, Bateson [loc. cit. p, 120) states that in tlie down 
 the chickens of Pile fowls have longitudinal stripes of light 
 chestnut. 

On June 4 I made a more thorough examination, but the 
 chickens were wild and diflficult to catch, and on reading my notes 
 I found I had only handle<] 13 out of 16. The first brood were 
 now almost fledged, the second about half-fledged, so that the 
 colour recorded now is that of the first plumage of true feathers. 
 The condition observed was as follows : — 

In three no colour was seen ; feathers all white. 

Four had much brown colour on back, wings, and bi'east. 

One had numerous scattered black feathers. 

Five were white Avith one or more black specks. 

The birds were examined thoroughly about six weeks latei', 
 namely on July 16 when they were completely fledged, and the 
 sex was recognisable from the size of the combs, although the tails 
 of the cocks were not fully developed. 

Cocks, total number 8. 

Four of these may be described as imperfect piles ; their 
 coloration was : — 

Numerous red patches on the saddle and backs of the wings, 
 slight yellow on neck hackles, and ver}- slight on loin hackles; 
 the rcht of the plumage white. Legs white with yellowish 
 tinge. 

The other four had much less colour, and some of them had 
 more black : — 

5. Same marking, but golden yellow instead of red ; only a 
 few red feathei's on the wings. 

6. Black spots on saddle and back of wings, one black spot on 
 the breast, and one on neck. Slight golden yellow on loin hackles. 

7. Only a. few small red patches on back of wings, but three or 
 four single black feathers ; also a tinge of gold on saddle. 

8. Black and red ticks on back of wings and back, more black 
 on the right side. 

Hens, total number 7. 

Four of these had a great deal of reddish-brown colour, diflerent 
 from that of the cocks, which was a brighter red. This colour 
 was " laced " all over back, and saddle hackles, more continuous and 
 uniform on back of wings. There was uniform brown on throat, 
 breast, and abdomen, but pale, i. e. diluted with white. Only the 
 end of the tail was quite white. (PI. I. fig. 2.) 

This coloration agrees fairly well with the description by 
 Mr. Douglas of hen piles in Wright's ' Book of Poultry,' 1885 :— 
 "Head light golden chestnut; hackle white, laced with yellow 
 chestnut; back a creamy white ground-colour, slightly laced, a 
 shade of gold prevailing ; salmon-coloured wing-coverts almost
