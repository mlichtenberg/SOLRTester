There are two males and eight females from Dran, in the Lano-. 
 bian Province of fcS. Annam, from an altitude of 'SOOO ft., and 
 Mr. Kloss has also sent me one male and one female from Kuala 
 Lumpur, Malay Peninsula. 

The measurements, and many other points, are very close to 
 those of Dr. Thorell's P. incanus from Borneo, but in that 
 species the first pair of legs is longest ; the remainder are shorter 
 in proportion in this species; the side-eyes of the rear row 
 are as large as the side- eyes of the front row instead of havino- 
 the rear row all nearly equal, and the rear laterals are on laro-e 
 tubercles instead of beins: sessile. '^
