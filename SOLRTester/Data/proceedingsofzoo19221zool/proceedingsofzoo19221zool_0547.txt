I. Introductory remarks : by Hugh Scott. 

The Nycteribiidaj are a family of wingless, pupiparous Diptera 
 of bizarre form, parasitic exclusively on bats. A tolerably com- 
 plete summary of what is known as to their biology will be found 
 in a paper by the writer in ' Parasitology ' (Cambridge), vol. ix., 
 no. 4, p. 593, 1917. The only species whose life-cycle has been 
 at all completely studied is the one which is the subject of this 
 present note, Cyclo-podia greeffi Karsch { = G. ruhiginosa Bigot : 
 see Scott, op. cit. p. 596, footnote). Its life-history was described 
 in a valuable paper by Rodhain a,nd Bequaert, "Observations 
 sur la biologie de Gyclopodia greeffi,^' Bull. Soc. Zool. France, 
 vol. xl., nos. 8-10, pp. 248-262, 1915. An abstract of this work 
 furmed a large part of the writei^'s summary in ' Parasitology,' 
 referred to above. 

Cyclopodia greeffi, was originally described (1884) from the 
 island of San Thome and the adjacent islet of Rolas, its liost 
 being the flying- fox Eidolon helvuin Kerr (= Cynonycteris 
 straminea Geoflfroy)*. It was further described (1891), under 
 the name C. ruhiginosa, by Bigot from Assinie on the Guinea 
 Coast (host not stated). The Imperial Burean of Entomology 
 submitted to the writer 9 S and 4 5 , now recorded for the nrst 
 time, from Ossidinge, Cross River, Cameroons (A. W. Pomeroy 
 coll., 1. xi. 1915, from a large bat of undetermined species); 
 and Monsieur E. Roubaud sent for determination in 1916 a 
 single S from Agouagon, Dahomey (host not exactly named). 
 Rodliain and Bequaert made their observations at Leopoldville, 
 Belgian Congo, the host being Eidolon helvum. 

In 1920 Mr. F. W. Frich, being in Europe on leave from 
 Trinidad, went on a mission to San Thome. There he rediscovered 
 Cyclopodia greeffi on its original host-species of bat, not only 
 finding adult examples on the bats, but breeding specimens from 
 the puparia. 

Mr. Urich also bred two examples of a Chalcid hyperparasite 
 from two of the Nycteribiid puparia. These are described 
 below by Dr. Waterston as a new species of Eupelmiis. They
