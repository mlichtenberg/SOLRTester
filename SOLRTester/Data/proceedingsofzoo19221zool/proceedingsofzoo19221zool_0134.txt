90 MR. F. BALFOUR-BROVVNE ON THE LIFE-HISTORY 

Agrionid dragonfly, Hydrohius fuscipes and Dytiscus, keeping 
 records of individuals, each in a separate tumbler, but I could 
 find no food which they would eat. The newly- hatched Pelohius 
 larva is only about 2 liim. long in body-length, so that minute 
 food was obviously necessary, but Paramcecium, upon which I 
 fed the newly-hatched dragonfly nymphs, had no attraction for 
 them, and minute alga3, Cladocera, and Oopepoda were equally 
 useless. I noticed, when I placed a larva in a tumbler with a 
 layer of mud at the bottom, that this mud was continually 
 examined and even burrowed into, which suggested that the 
 necessary food wns some mud-inhabiting species. As, however, 
 these larvae also died, I made a journey to one of the ponds where 
 the beetle occurred and brought home a supply of mud from 
 there, and, on using this in the tumblers, it was at once obvious 
 that the food-problem was solved. This mud was swarming with 
 T'ubifex, and it was most interesting to watch the larva hunting 
 for and capturing its prey. It would move slowly over the 
 surface, touching it with its antennae and palpi, and, on dis- 
 covering a Tubifex burrow, the larva would either at once leap 
 into it, sometimes disappearing except for the apices of its 
 " tails," or it would sit and watch, like a cat at a mouse-hole, its 
 action presumably depending vipon the position of the worm in 
 the burrow. Sometimes the snatch at the prey would fail and 
 the larva would move elsewhere, but with these first-stage larvte 
 it was difficult to decide whether the pounce had been successful, 
 as it was rare for, the larva to appear from the burrow with the 
 worm in its mouth. With the larger larvas one could see the 
 struggle, the worm tidying to withdraw to the bottom of the burrow, 
 and the larva, as it were, sitting back upon its haunches and 
 pulling with all its might to get the worm out. In the case of 
 these lai-ger larva?, however, the feeding was sometimes done in 
 the burrow. 

The feeding process is rather peculiar ; the larva sits motionless 
 with most of the worm projecting from its mouth and wriggling 
 furiously, the larva to all appearance doing nothing ; suddenly, 
 however, the latter makes a gulp, and a little of the projecting 
 part of the worm disappears into the mouth. After a short 
 interval another gulp takes place, and thus by a series of gulps 
 the worm disappears down the " throat." The larva apparently 
 always seizes the worm by the end, never by the middle. 

So far as I could find, Tubifex is the only food of the larval 
 Pelohius, as, although I tried various other materials and could 
 get the larva? to eat Chironomus larvae, I never succeeded in 
 rearing one on any diet other than the little red worm.

The gulping down of the Avorm struck me as rather extra- 
 ordinar3\ There was no chewing or biting, and yet an examination 
 of the contents of the alimentary canal always showed chewed-up
