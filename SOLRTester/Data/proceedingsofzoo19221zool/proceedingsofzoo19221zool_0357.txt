The cephalic part of the cephalothorax is straight and narrow, 
 truncate in front, the thoracic part sloping rather steeply there- 
 from to the side-margins. The rear row of eyes are equal and 
 equidistant their diameter apart, and so far procurved that a 
 line across the upper points of the laterals is wholly below the 
 lower edge of the median. The front row is shorter and like- 
 wise procurved, the eyes about the same size as the rear row, 
 beino- about two-thirds of their diameter apart, and only so much 
 procurved that the upper points of the laterals reach as far back 
 as the centres of the median.
