§ 5. Before proceeding to considei^ the specific cliai'acters 
 selected for examination and criticism, it will be well to recognize 
 clearly the typical architecture of a Dendronephthya polyp as

Armature of lateral point of Polyp. 

regards its external spiculation (text-fig. 4). When every por- 
 tion is represented, the ascending order above the polyp stalk 
 is as follows : — 

(1) The spicules of the supporting bundle (Stutzbiindel), several 

of which are usually very large (often up to 3 or 4 mm. in 
 length) and often projecting beyond the polyp for a 
 distance of 0"5-l-5 mm. It is useful to distinguish in the 
 supporting bundle the main spicules and the accessory 
 spicules, the latter often mingling gradually with those of 
 the polyp stalk. 

(2) The "crown," consisting of a few rows, very commonly 

three, of spicules arranged horizontally round the base of 
 the anthocodial part of the polyp. 

(3) The anthocodial armature, in the strict sense, which 

consists mainly of the spicules entering into the com- 
 position of each of the eight points. Between each pair 
 of points tiny spicules are frequently found. These I term 
 intermediates and discount their value because they are 
 so variable. 

(4) Yery minute spicules on the tentacles, the nature and 

number of which seem to be quite unimportant.
