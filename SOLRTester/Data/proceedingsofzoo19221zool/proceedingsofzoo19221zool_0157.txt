sacs, must therefox-e ripen in the general body-cavity ; and the 
 incompleteness of the septa allows them to become widely 
 distributed, both through the parent animal and the posterior 
 components of the chain. I believe, however, that the observa- 
 tions I have made, only a part of which I record below, show 
 that this is not the case, and that the cells are really produced in 
 all pai"ts of the chain. 

Whether the ovaries also are similarly non-localized I cannot 
 say. I have described the ovaries as definite organs — as cellular 
 aggregates or as hyaline masses of nucleated protoplasm in 
 which cell outlines were not visible, suspended in the ventral 
 part of the body-cavity on fine strands in front of the level of 
 the setfe of segment vi {i. e., about the position where septum 5/6 
 would normall}^ be). The ovaries of C, diaphanits are several 
 times figured by Vejdovsky as definite spherical or pear-shaped 
 masses : they had previously been described by Lankester, and 
 were seen by Yejdovsky also, in C. limncei. Ova are, however, 
 sometimes met with in the hinder animals of a chain of C. orien- 
 talis; in their early stages, moreover, male and female cells are 
 indistinguishable; and it is possible that in some of the examples 
 which I assume below to be the early stages of the male 
 px-odncts, the cells may be young ova.

 Chcetogaster orientals. 

The above figure represents in outline a specimen of Chcetogaster 
 orientalis, in which the process of fission has demarcated eight 
 future individuals, including the anterior one which we may 
 regard as the parent. The first constriction probably appeared 
 between the four anterior and the four posterior components of 
 the chain, and the first break in the chain would subsequently 
 take place here ; the fifth individual was at the time of observa- 
 tion the most completely differentiated (after the most anterior 
 or parent). The figures aiid their reference lines indicate the 
 places where the sexual cells were visible. 

None were seen at any stage of development in the living 
 animal in the front part of the parent, nor were gonads distin- 
 guishable ; subsequently, after staining, examination in cedar oil 
 showed a small morula, of about four cells, ventrally by the side
