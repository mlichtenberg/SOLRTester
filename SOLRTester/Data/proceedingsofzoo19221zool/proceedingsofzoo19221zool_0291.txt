PARASITES OF ELEPHANTS, 235 

Spicules. — Tlie two similar spicules are gracefully curved 
 ventrally. Their tips are fine and bent dorsally. They are 
 •91 mm. in length. The accessory piece is "19 mm. in length. 
 It is concave ventrally, providing a canal for the spicules. It 
 is thicker at its cephalic than at its caudal end. 

Termination of female. — The tail of the female is ratlier broad. 
 The tip in most specimens is diseased and deeply pigmented, 
 but a few retain the tip, which is fine. The tail is 2-66 mm. 
 in length. The anal opening is slightly raised above the surface. 

Ova. — The ova in tlie vagina are thin-shelled, measuring 88 /a 
 by 48 jx. They contain a morula. 

Habitat. Intestine of African elephant (Belgian Congo and 
 XJeanda). 

QuiLONiA AFRicANA Lane, 1921. 

This species is represented by more specimens than any 
 other in the Uganda material. It ngrees in all characters 
 with Lane's description, except in the length of the female 
 tail and the distance of the vulva from the anus. These were 
 given by Lane as 4 mm. the length of the tail, and 4 mm. the 
 distance of the vulva from the anus. On re-examining Lane's 
 type-species, kept in the Natural History Museum, I could not 
 find a single specimen with these measurements. All corre- 
 spond to "my previously taken measurements, being 3'6 mm, 
 length of tail, and 3-25 mm, distance of vulva from the anus. 
 Lieut. -Col. Lane ascribes this to the fact that the proofs of his 
 paper were not corrected by him. (For detailed measurements 
 based on my observation, see Table II.) 

Habitat. Stomach of African elephant (South Africa and 
 Uganda). 

QuiLONiA UGANDA Khalil, 1922, (Text-figs. 29-34.) 

Material. — The material consisted of fifteen specimens sorted 
 from the Uganda collection. 

Shape of the body. — The body is short and straight. The 
 female is slightly longer and thicker than the male. The male 
 is 11-5-12 mm, long and the female is 16 mm, long. The 
 maximum diameter of the body is about the middle. It is 
 .55 mm. in the male and '64 mm. in the female. 

Skin. — The cuticle is striated more closely near the head end 
 than in the middle of the body. Near the head the intervals 
 between each two striations is '01 mm,, near the middle of the 
 body it is '02 mm. 

Mouth collar. — The mouth collar is distinctly sepaiated from the 
 body by a groove. It is rounded in outline, -04 mm. in length 
 and "19 mm. in diameter. 

Anterior leaf crown. — Fi^om the inner surface of the mouth 
 collar projects the anterior leaf-crown. It consists of twelve
