supply of the acacia scrub wliich forms its diet, and water, there 
 is no reason to fear its extinction. 

Buffalo. — After the big rinderpest epidemic it was feared that 
 these fine beasts were practically extinct, and for some 20 years 
 or so they were undoubtedly rare. 

They have, however, gradually increased in certain areas, and no 
 anxiety need now be exercised as to their extinction. There are, 
 it is believed, considerable numbers in the Southern Reserve, on 
 the northern stretches of Laikipia, in Southern Kitui, and various 
 other places. 

A considerable number also frequent the coastal area where the 
 bush is very thick, a,nd up to recently a few even annually visited 
 the mainland opposite Mombasa town, but left the spot when the 
 bush was cleared to make a plantation. In the spring of 1919 
 about half a dozen visited the place they knew, but finding no 
 cover they retreated into the interior ; one, however, swam across 
 the mouths of the two harbours and landed on the mainland 
 south of the island, a distance of over half a mile. 

In the old days buffalo could be seen in the early part of the 
 day and in the late afternoon grazing out in the open like herds^ 
 of cattle, but since the epidemic this is very rarely the case. 
 They now live in dense bush, only coming to graze in the open at 
 night, retiring to the bush again at daAvn. Possibly now there 
 are fewer of them they have lost the confidence they formerly 
 possessed. 

The geographical range of the buffalo is remarkable, for, as I 
 have remarked, they frequent the hot coast-lands, and then, again,, 
 a desiccated buffalo carcase is recorded fi-om the foot of a glacier 
 on Mount Kenya. As might be expected, the animals inhabiting 
 the higher altitudes have thicker coats than those at the coast. 

Hippopotamus. — This beast is decreasing at a great rate ; in 
 the old days the middle and upper Tana swarmed with them, but 
 now not more than 5 per cent, survive. The same applies to the 
 Athi River ; they have also greatly decreased in Lake Victoria 
 and in other smaller lakes. 

Unfortunately the Game Reserves do not contain much water 
 suitable for them, but it will be a long time before they disappear 
 from the swampy bays on Lake Victoria, and from some of the 
 more remote rivers, such as the lower course of the Nyiro which 
 flows into the Lorian Swamp. 

Giraffe. — The area occupied by this fine beast is becoming 
 more restricted every year, and the settlement of the Uasingishu 
 plateau will probably settle the fate of the beautiful subspecies 
 which is found there, for the Dutch colonists find it hard to refrain 
 from slaughtering them, as giraffe hide has a peculiar quality
