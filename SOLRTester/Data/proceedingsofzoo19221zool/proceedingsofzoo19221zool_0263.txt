in appearance. Posterior to the hea.d a cnticular expansion is 
 present on either side of the body. The female is practically 
 straight ; its tail is very long and is gnidiially attenuated to a 
 fine point. The caudal end of the male is bent towards the 
 ventral surface, and its end is more rounded than in the female. 
 Skin. — The cuticle is finely striated at intervals of '007 mm, 
 throughout the whole length of the body. The cuticular 
 expansions near the cephalic end of the body are placed on both 
 lateral sides, and extend from the level of the pharynx to prac- 
 tically the middle of the (esophagus. They are -3 ram. in length 
 and '037 mm. maximum breadth, and are striated.

Mouth collar. — -The mouth collar is very short and has a 
 rounded shape. It is "012 mm. long and -06 mm. in diameter. 
 The mouth-opening is practically circular and is surrounded by 
 ten small lips. The lip in the mid-ventral line and that in the 
 mid-dorsal line are the lai'gest and broadest. The lips placed on 
 either side of these lines are smaller and rounded. There is no 
 mouth capsule. 

Pharynx. — This is a short muscular canal. Its musculature is 
 more closely set and of a finer texture than that in the succeeding 
 oesophagus. It is also distinctly demarcated from it by a deep 
 groove. For these reasons I named that specialized part of the 
 oesophagus the pharynx. The shape of the pharynx is cylindrical, 
 with a small bulging in the middle. It is 'OSS mm. long and 
 •06 mm. maximum diameter. From its cephalic end project 
 conical processes ; their apices ai-e directed antero-laterally. The 
 number of these processes and their structure can only be 
 ascertained under the oil immersion lens. They are eight in 
 number surrounding the mouth-opening, and they are muscular
