the stock of game in the country as a whole to-day with that in 
 say 1895, probaljly the present stock would only represent 15 per 
 cent, to 20 per cent, of the former : this is, however, only to be 
 expected when one considers that upwards of 6000 square miles 
 of land, most of it game country, has been alienated to colonists. 
 I am not complaining, for it cannot be expected that fertile 
 lands which will provide homes for people of our race and grow 
 products essential to civilization, Avill lemain for ever in the 
 possession of wild game. 

I Avill, however, revert to the question of the future of the game 
 later on, and now propose to recall the conditions which prevailed 
 20 years ago before man took a hand in the matter, i. e. to any 
 great extent. 

At that time the areas noted for great profusion of game were 
 the Atlii and Kapiti Plains, the Yatta Plateau, the iSerengeti 
 Plains, the Loita Plains, the Rift Yalley, and the Uasingishu 
 Plateau, A ])ortion of the Kapiti Plains and the Loita Plains 
 are included in the game reserves, so presumably carry a good 
 stock in places, but all the other areas are decimated, mostly 
 owing to the eftect of settlement. 

The main factors which determined the distribution of game 
 in the early days were yearly variations in rainfall which resulted 
 in a sufficiency or insufficiency of grazing in particular areas ; 
 epidemic diseases also periodically affected certain species, and 
 the number of carnivores also counted. All these factors operate 
 at present, but the first mentioned, viz., the variation in rainfall, 
 operates more hai"shly than formerly, for nowadays the area over 
 which the game can migrate in search of grazing is restricted. 
 If, for instance, the Southern Game Reserve is seriously affected 
 by drought, large numbers of game are doomed ; some may 
 â– attempt to migrate into the farm lands, but many are shot down, 
 and the survivors retreat to the reserve where the grazing is 
 finished and many of the water-holes dry. A good example of 
 this occurred in 1910, when the plains were so dry that zebra and 
 liartebeest came up in force into the town of Nairobi, i-egardless 
 of man, in their search for water ; the lions followed them and 
 Ivilled game nightly in the open land in the centre of the town. 
 Natives and others killed many of the invaders, and the emaciated 
 remnant was driven back to the plains. 

Speaking of epidemics, one of my earliest recollections in East 
 Africa was the great rinderpest visitation of 1891. I was then 
 exploring the course of the Tana River, and the buffalo Avere 
 coming down to that river literally in thousands to die. The 
 bush country fringing the Tana between Hameye and Mumoni is 
 not ideal buffalo country, for the grazing is not too plentiful at 
 any time, but once they conti'acted the disease they appeared to 
 be impelled to seek water, doubtless coming from great distances 
 to the river, and I estimate that in the stretch of countr}^ above 
 mentioned, a distance of about 80 miles, we saw several thousand 
 buffalo in all stages of disease and death, attended by vultuies and
