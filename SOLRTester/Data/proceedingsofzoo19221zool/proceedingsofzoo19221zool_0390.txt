MR. G. BLAINE ON THE ZEBRAS 

111 the following table the difl'erences between the skulls of 
 Hippotragus luger and Hipjyotragus variani are set forth : â€” 

H. niger. 

Pace shorter and broader, the frontal 
 tield which gives rise to the horns 
 being more prominently developed, 
 with the bases of tlie horns directed 
 more obliquely backwards. 

Nasals shorter, their frontal extremities 
 not reaching the plane of the ante- 
 orbital processes. 

Premaxillse less spatulate. 

Lacrymal depression scarcely defined. 

Orbits round. 

Maxillse showing a distinct groove 

running parallel to the inferior border 

of the nasals, and continued across the 

iipper ends of the premaxillaj. 
 Tympanic bulla3 small, with styliform 

process flattened and blade-like. 

Paroccipital processes wide,flattened,with 
 posterior margins convex. Viewed 
 from behind they curve slightly out- 
 wards, then downwards and inwards 
 at their apices, a large portion of their 
 posterior borders being on a level with 
 the posterior face of the condj'les. 

Foramen ovale large and oval. 

Mesopterygoid fossa wide, triangular in 
 shape, with its containing walls 
 diverging from the basisphenoid down- 
 wards, the post-hamular margins 
 forming everted flanges. 

Lateral fossae wide. 

H. variani. 

Face longer and narrower, with less ex- 
 tensive frontal field and the bases of 
 the horns rising nearly vertically and 
 directly over the orbits. 

Nasals longer, their frontal extremities 

reaching the plane of the ante-orbital 

processes. 
 Premaxillse spatulate, with broadly 

flanged anterior margins. 
 Lacrymal depression clearly defined. 
 Orbits oval, the vertical axis being longest. 
 Maxillce showing only faint traces of 

groove. 

Tympanic bullas large, with styliform 
 process round, very small and spike- 
 like. 

Paroccipital i^rocesses narrow, with 
 straight posterior margins and no 
 lateral curvature, but having a strong 
 forward and slight inward inclination. 
 They are more forward in position, 
 being almost wholly in advance of the 
 condyles. 

Foramen ovale small and round. 

Mesopterj'goid fossa narrow, with 
 parallel walls. 

Ascending wall of maxilla behind tlie 

tooth-row nearly vertical, and strongly 

carinated. 
 Posterior palatine notches in line with, 

or in front of the plane of the posterior 

edges of the last molars. 
 Teeth smaller. 

Lateral fossae narrower, being constricted 
 by the inflation of the posterior ascend- 
 ing walls of the maxilla?. 

Ascending wall of maxilla behind the 
 tooth-row obliqueb' directed with its 
 suface inflated, and less carinated. 

Posterior x>alatine notches behind the 
 plane of the posterior edges of the 
 last molars. 

Teeth larger. 

The skull of H. equinus resembles that of H. niger, and differs 
 from H. variani in the form and position of its paroccipital pro- 
 cesses, in the open ti-iangular outline of the mesopterygoid fossa, 
 and in the vertical direction of the ascending walls of the maxillae, 
 which are laterally compressed and prominently carinated.
