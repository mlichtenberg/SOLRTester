lingual avtery and brandies of glosso-phai-yngeal nerve as in Man, 
 and the well-marked submaxillary gland lies on its surface. It is 
 united to its fellow to form one sheet. It is continuous with the 
 sterno-hyoid. 

The pectoralis major (text-fig. 10 A) is strong and complex, and 
 consists of several parts. The first is strong and thick, and 
 arises from the margin of the sternal end of the clavicle, the 
 entire length of the sternum, the inner ends of the costal cai-ti- 
 lages, and the aponeurosis over the rectus abdominis in the infra- 
 sternal fossa. Its sujDerficial fibres fuse with those of the deltoid.

The second part covers the inner part of the chest-wall and part 
 of the external oblique aponeurosis, and joins the deep aspect of 
 the first part which is inserted into the capsule of the shoulder- 
 joint and the prominent pectoral ridge on the humerus. A third 
 part arises from the second, third, fourth, and fifth costal carti- 
 lages and intercostal muscles in the intervening spaces, and is 
 inserted into the capsule of the shoulder-joint and deep part of
