sidevable number of Europeans a,nd natives ; furtlicr, the income 
 from licenses averaged over £10,000 per annum. 

It is, however, parochial to assess the value of the game on 
 these lines, and 1 feel sure that our American friends do not 
 measure the vahie of their fine resei-ves in terms of dollars. 

In my view the wonderful fauna of our East African posses- 
 sions does not solely belong to the people who happen to settle 
 there, and who somewhat reluctantly vote a minimum amount 
 per annum for its preservation — it belongs to the Empire — and 
 should not be entirelj^ at the mercy of local interests. 

Of course, as I said before, settlement must go on and full con- 
 sideration must be given to the economic interests of the colonists, 
 and sympathetic attention to complaints regarding the depre- 
 dations of game, as well as the question of game and cattle 
 diseases. Generally the relations between the Game Department 
 and the colonists require great tact and judgment. 

I believe that a proposal to reduce the game reserves materially 
 would have to obtain the Secretar}'- of State's approval, but pi'e- 
 sumably he would follow the recommendations made by the 
 Governor at the time, and that officer's views might be 
 colovu-ed by the limited view of his Legislative Council, and 
 therein is the danger. 

1 should like to see a Committee selected from the Council 
 of this Society and the Council of the Society for the preservation 
 of the fauna of the Empire duly recognised by the Home Govern- 
 ment as the official advisers oii the question of game preservation. 
 in East Africa, and on the policy of the Game Departments in the 
 various Crown Colonies and the mandatory territorj" of 
 Tanganyika. 

If this could be bi'ought about I feel sure that a more scientific- 
 treatment of the question would ensue. 

I am loth to introduce any personal note, but will venture to- 
 record that the present Game Warden of Kenya is devoted to the 
 game in his care, and has an unrivalled field natviralisfs know- 
 ledge of the fauna of the country ; he, moreover, does all that 
 is possible with the limited staff' at his disposal. He would 
 probabl}^ be extremely thankful to receive support from a body 
 of great weight oiitside the country ; such supjjort could not 
 fail to strengthen his hands, and to give him greater confidence 
 in his eff'orts. 

I, however, strongly desire to urge that the whole outlook should 
 be reviewed on a scientific basis, and that the biononjics of the 
 fauna be given greatei- prominence. Up to now what may be 
 termed a hand to mouth policy has been the vogue. It is true- 
 that the vai'ious Governors have been more or less interested in 
 sport, and have generally supported game preservation, but no 
 one knows whether a Governor might appear whose policy would 
 render nugatory any systematic game preservation. 

Much, moreover, requires to be done if the Reserves are to be-
