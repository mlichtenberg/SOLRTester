floor near the itestis, sometimes actually surrounding the 
 attachment of the testis as in Dravnda jajwnica. The vas 
 deferens leads off from the funnel, and descends on the septum 
 to the ventral body-wall (text-fig. 10).

(2) The Testis Sacs of the Moniligastrklce considered as 
 Segments. 

Leaving aside for the moment the Moniligastridse, it will be 
 seen from the above that throughout the Oligochaeta the testis is 
 morphologically on the posterior face of the anterior septum of 
 its segment, of the peritoneal covering of which it is a proli- 
 feration ; and the funnel faces it on the anterior face of the 
 posterior septum, of the peritoneal covering of which it is a 
 modification. On now comparing the figure which represents the 
 condition in the Moniligastridse (text-fig. 10) it is evident that 
 the most feasible explanation of the nature of the testis sacs of 
 this family is that which would regard them as the equivalent of 
 segments, of which the anterior and posterior walls have fused 
 together for the greater part of their extent. 

The cavity of the sacs cannot be a mere split in the septum, 
 since it is lined throughout with epithelium. Following the 
 usual rule, the cavity must be coelomic, and the epithelium 
 peritoneal epithelium. 

In Syngenodrilus, to which reference will again be made in tlie 
 sequel, there is given off' from the posterior .testis sac a seminal 
 vesicle (text-fig\ 16) in precisely the same way as the seminal 
 vesicle is given off from the testis segment in the more primitive 
 forms {cf. text-fig. 7). 

Again, we have seen in the foregoing article how, in the 
 genera Moniligaster and Dmivida, there is a tendency to shut oft' 
 the ovaries and their funnels in special chambers. These 
 chambers represent segment xi, and various stages in the gradual 
 limitation of the extent of this segment can be traced in actually 
 existing forms. The ovarian chamber contains the ovaries and
