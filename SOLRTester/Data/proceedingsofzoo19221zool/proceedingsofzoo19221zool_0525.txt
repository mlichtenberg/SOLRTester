There is only one splanchnic nerve on the right side, but four 
 form a loop on the left. The connections which they establish 
 through the solar plexus, and by direct branches to the organs, are 
 numerous and complicated, but careful dissection enables one to 
 see the following offshoots : â€” 

a. Superior mesenteric plexus (S.M.P). 

b. Splenic plexus (S.P). 

c. Left renal and suprai'enal plexuses (L.R.P). 

d. Right renal plexus (R.R.P). 

e. Aortic plexus (A.P). 

f. Inferior mesenteric plexus (I.M.P).

The Inferior Mesenteric Plexus sends branches to the lai'ge 
 intestine, and a strong cord i-uns down into the pelvis. Gaining 
 the dorsal aspect of the vesiculse seminales it forms a crescentic 
 expansion, whence branches run to the left sacral plexus and 
 pelvic viscera. 

The Brachial Plexus (text-fig. 23) is formed by the fourth to 
 eighth cervical nerves, and branches of communication run to the 
 cervical plexus and first dorsal nerve (O.C.P and O.D.I). In 
 Macacus rhesus and Homo the fourth nerve only communicates,
