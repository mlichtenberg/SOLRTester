towards the autei'ior end until it reaches the posterior iiiargiii of 
 the vesicular swelling, where it is then 190 /u broad. Posteriorly 
 the narrowing is more gradujil until the level of the vaginal 
 opening, where the breadth is 360^ ; from here the narrowing is 
 very marked, and ends in a pointed tail. 

In a male 12*5 mm. long the breadth of the body at the base of 
 the vesicular swelling is 170/./. From here the breadth increases 
 until a maximum of 380 ju is reached about half-way down the 
 length of the worm ; posteriorly the body tapers until the 
 anterior margin of the bursa is reached, where the breadth is then 
 227 /x.

The mouth collar surrounds the mouth capsule (text-fig. 2) ; 
 this latter is a chitinous structure whose breadth is about three 
 times its depth ; it is somewhat cylindrical in shape, having its 
 anterior opening slightly smaller than its posterior ; anteriorly it 
 bears a crown of ten large leaf elements, which pass through tlie 
 mouth and whose extremities are slightly recurved over the 
 anterior part of the mouth collar. An internal leaf- crown is 
 present, and it consists of about twice as many small elements as 
 the external leaf-crown. The mouth aperture is surrounded by 
 the usual six papillae, two short a.nd broad laterals, and four 
 longer submedians which pierce the mouth collar.
