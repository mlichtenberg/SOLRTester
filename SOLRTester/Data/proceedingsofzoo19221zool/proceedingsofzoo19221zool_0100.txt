masses : polyp stalks long ; supporting bundle very strong ; point 
 spicules 5-6 with the uppermost pair sti-onger and projecting ; 
 no crown ; grade IV. ; spicules : very abundant spindles on the 
 polyp stalks, of the polyps not on the collar sigmoid spindles, and 
 of the collar irregular interlocking quadrangular " crosses " ; 
 colour : polyps of the foliaceous collar bright red, rest of the 
 polyps white. 

Anthocodial Grade and Formula : — 

lY. = 5-6 p + Cr + very strong S.B. 

Descriptive Notes : — 

1. Colony as a lohole. Two colonies of which the larger 
 measures, as regards the polyparium, 9*5 cm. high, 12 cm. broad, 
 and 5 cm. in thickness. 

2. Branching. Umbellate, referable to Klikenthal's section 
 XJmbellatae, subsection with the umbels forming large hemi- 
 spherical masses, and to the group coUaris, where the contour is 
 broken by the clefts between the masses. Quite divergent, 
 however, in having only a short stalk, but this is probably only 
 a growth condition related to the nature of the substi-atum. At 
 the top of the short stalk the basal branches are foliaceous and 
 form a collar. 

3. Colouring. Polyps of the foliaceous collar are bright red ; 
 those of the rest of the colony white (not purple as in the 
 ' Challenger,' specimen), but some of them show a tinge of red. 

4. Polyp stalks are long. 

5. Polyps arranged in small circular Text-fig. 20. 
 masses. 

6. Polyp spicules. The anthocodial 
 armature shows 8 double rows of 5-6 
 converging pairs of spindles, and one at 
 the top of each row may be much 
 stronger than its neighbour and project 
 beyond the polyp. These 8 projecting 
 spines catch the eye at once. 

The supporting bundle is very strong, 
 with one spindle projecting far beyond 
 the polyp. 

7. Other spicules. The predominant 
 spicules of the polyps not on the collar n. coUaris Wr. & Stud. 
 are spinulate slightly sigmoid spindles, 

the "f's" of the ' Challenger' description. The abundant spindles 
 on the polyp stalks are almost en chevron. The characteristic 
 spicules of the collar region are irregularly quadrangular bodies 
 with very rough protuberances which secure interlocking. They 
 correspond to what are called " crosses " by Wright and Studer. 
 There are also spindles enlarged at one end into very rough 
 clubs, curved spindles with very strong protuberances on the 
 convex side, and irregular bodies like teeth with many roots.
