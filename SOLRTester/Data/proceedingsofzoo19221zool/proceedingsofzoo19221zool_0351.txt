SPIDERS FROM SOUTH ANNAM. 295 

The cephalothorax is half a millimetre longer than broad, 
 rounded at the sides, truncate in front, curving inwards at 
 the rear. The eye-space is raised up above the adjacent area 
 at the sides and in front, but at the rear is on a level Avith 
 the dorsal surface. 

The rear row of eyes is recurved, the median sessile 1^ diameters 
 apart. The laterals on prominences are 1| times as large and 
 1^ times as far away as the median are from one another. The 
 front row are only slightly recurved, the laterals as large as the 
 i-ear laterals. The front median are rather smaller than the rear 
 median, Ig diameters apart, half that distance from the laterals, 
 and 2 diameters from the rear median. The clypeus is about the 
 depth of the diameter of the rear median eyes. 

The mandibles are conical, slightly kneed at the base, with 
 three equal teeth on the inner falx-sheath margin and one quite 
 small below them. 

The lip is convex, as broad as long, rounded at the sides, trun- 
 cate in front, less than half as long as the maxillpe, which are 
 widest in front and narrowed at the base to one-half the width 
 in front. 

The sternum is as broad as long, rounded at the sides, 
 truncate in front, and thickly covered with upstanding bristly 
 hair. 

The legs are moderately stout, Avith fine downlying hair, three 
 pairs of spines under each tibia, and three long ones on the outer 
 side of i, Scopulse on all tarsi and on metatarsus of i. and ii. 
 Two claws with about 7 or 8 pectinations. On the tibial and 
 distal joint of the palp are three spines each. 

The epigyne consists of a pair of convex bean-shaped promi- 
 nences, placed longitudinally a short distance apart, narrowed at 
 the upper ends to one-half the width at the base. Above each of 
 them is an oval hollow. The whole lies on a semi-oval promi- 
 nence covered with short rough hair. 

In the Male the rear row of eyes is less recurved and the 
 abdomen narrower in comparison with its length. 

On the outer side of the tibial joint of the palp is a rather long, 
 hollowed, pointed apophysis, with three curved spines on the 
 inner side. A fine pointed flagellum passes about half-way round 
 the bulb, and a stouter doubly-curved apophysis projects from 
 the opposite side.
