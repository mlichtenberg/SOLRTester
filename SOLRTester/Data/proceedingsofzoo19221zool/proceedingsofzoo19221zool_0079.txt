depend on conditions of growtii. On this view, tlie occurrence 
 of a species witli tlie same anthocodial armature in each of the 
 three groups would not mean that a similar speci:i,lization had 
 occurred three times on difterent lines of evolution ; it vuould 
 mean that one and the same species occurred in three diflerent 
 vegetative forms — Glomerate, Divaricate, and Umbellate, which 
 depended on gj'owth conditions. 

For various reasons this view is improbable :— (1) In many 
 cases the Glomerate, Divaricate, or Umbellate mode of growth 
 is clearly expressed in young forms 1-3 cm. high. (2) When 
 exactly the same anthocodial armature occurs in two or all of 
 the three groups, the two or three species in question differ in 
 other details, such as the length of the polyp stalk, the nature of 
 the supporting bundle, and the spiculation. This does not look 
 like the occurrence of the same species in three vegetative guises. 
 There are Umbellate colonies, however, which seem to pass 
 through a Divaricate stage when they are young and small, but 
 these are in my experience fewer than forms which are Umbel- 
 late from near the start.

In support of the view that a colony usually shows vei y early 
 whether it is going to be Glomerate, Divaricate, or Umbellate, 
 I have given a series of diagrammatic representations of a 
 dozen small colonies drawn to actual size. . It goes without 
 saying that the definite architecture cannot be expressed until 
 there are quite a, number of polyps in the colony. But the limit 
 is uncertain. The central figure of the group depicts the 
 primitive, quite undifferentiated colony from which soon the 
 distinctive form embodies itself. Above it to the left are 
 Glomerates, to the right Umbellates, while below is a row of 
 Divaricates.
