The ovarian jjhamber corresponds to the ovarian segment in 
 the other genera; as in Eupolygaster, there is a single pair 
 of spermathecae and a single set of male organs. But there is 
 a further reduction still— another segment has disappeared. 
 Assuming for the moment that the similarly lettered segments 
 in text-figs. 11 and 13 correspond, c with c and g with gr, it will 
 be seen that the single testis sac of Drawida is left to correspond 
 with the two testis sacs and the intervening segment e of Desmo- 
 gaster ; in other words, there has been a squeezing together of 
 the segments, and the two testis sacs have fused. This fusion 
 probably gave at first a single sac with a vertical diaphragm ; 
 later the diaphragm disappeared (c/. text-fig. 14, c). In thus 
 fusing, the testis sacs have annihilated the space e — in other 
 words, the cavity of the segment between them ; the most 
 posterior heart, which was in this space, has also disappeared, 
 and hence in these two genera, Drawida and MoniUgaster, the 
 last heart is in the segment in front of the testis sac. The 
 actually existing testis, funnel and duct of these genera may not 
 improbably be the testis of the original anterior sac and the 
 funnel and duct of the posterior. 

Michaelsen (12) imagines the genns Drawida to have arisen in 
 a rather diflerent way—by the disappearance of the anterior set
