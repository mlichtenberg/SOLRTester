The classifications of the Hystricomorpha in English text-books 
 of Zoology are based upon the one proposed by Alston in 1876 
 (P. Z. >S. 1876, pp. 90-97), which was itself an amplification and 
 in some particulars a modification of the arrangement suggested 
 by Waterhouse in 1848. Alston added to the group the'family 
 Dinomyidae, which, following Peters, he placed between the 
 Dasyproctidfe and Caviidse ; and the Ctenodactylin^, which he 
 ranked as a subfamily of Octodontidje. He also transferred 
 Petromys from the Echymyina (Echinomyinje), where it was 
 placed by Waterhouse, to the Octodontinae. 

His system, adopted to the letter by Flower and Lydekker 
 (' Mammals Living and Extinct,' pp. 484-491), was as follows: — 

Hystricomorpha. 

1. Octodontidas. 

Ctenodactylinae (^Ctenodactylus, Pectinator). 

Octodontina? {Petromys, Ctenomys, Schizodon, Spcdaco2ms, 

Octodon, Abroconia). 
 Echinomyinpe (Carterodon, Myopotcmms, Cer corny s, Lon- 

cheres, Mesomys, Ecliinomys, Dactylomys, Plagiodontia, 

Capj^omys, Atdacodus). 

2. Hystricidse. 

Sphingurin£e {Ch(Etomys, Sjylnngurus, Enjthizon). 
 Hystricinae [Atherura, Hystrix). 

3. Chinchillidse {ChinchUla, Lagidmm, Lagostoinus). 

4. Dasyproctidae {Dasyj^rocta, Cadogenys). 

5. Dinomyidae (Dinomys). 

6. Caviidae (Cavia, DoUchotis, Hydrocluerus)
