2. Branching. Markedly divaricate but not markedly flat- 
 tened. The contour of the colony is irregular. These features 
 point to the suensoni section, and in that section the only species 
 to wliich the specimens could be referred is D. ehrenhevgi. The 
 mode of branching is the same, and the resemblance of these 
 specimens to Kiikenthal's coloured figures is striking except that 
 they have much less of a sterile stalk, 

3. Coloicring. Rich red in the ccenenchyma and with greyish- 
 yellow anthocodial spicules. 

4. Pol^/p stalks short. Text-fig. 11. 

5. Polyps arranged in little divaricate ..... 
 groups of about 5-8. 

6. Polyp spicules. There ai'e in most 
 6 pairs of white spicules arranged en 
 chevron in each of the anthocodial lines : 
 in Kiikenthal's forms there were 4-5. 
 There is no very distinct crown. The 
 supporting bundle consists of thick, 
 rough red spindles (up to 1*5 mm.), 
 projecting freely for about 0"5 mm. 

7. Other spicules. The canal-walls 
 show a few bent, rough spindles. The 
 spicules of the stalk cortex are mostly 
 very distinctive, long (up to 3"5 mm.), 
 curved, red spindles, also ovals and b. ehrenlergi Kiib. 
 irregular clubs covered with massive 

tubercles mainly with very characteristic rough blunt lieads. 
 There are also very rough discs, approaching spheres, covered 
 with the same massive tubercles. A few triradiate forms occur 
 in the lower cortex. Not very numerous, there are also minute, 
 colourless, irregular capstans. 

Deduction : — The specimens agree with D. ehrenhergi in 
 having : — 

(1) 6 pairs of spicules, in most cases, in the anthocodise ; 

(2) supporting bundle of rough spindles slightly projecting ; 

(3) polyps in little divaricate groups of about 5 -8 ; 

(4) spiculation of the canal walls ; 

(5) mode of branching. 

Localities: — Stations 164, 258. 

5. Dendronephtliya suensoni (Holm). 

Described by Holm, Zool. Jahrb. viii. Syst. pp. 35-37 (1895). 

Diagnosis : — Divaricate ; outline irregular ; not obviously 
 flattened; polyps in little groups (4-10), distinctly scattei'ed ; 
 polyp stalks medium; supporting bundle medium; point spicules 
 one pair only, of which one member is a long projecting curved 
 spindle associated with a much smaller one at its base ; crown of 
 some 6 rows of horizontally disposed spindles ; grade VI. ;
