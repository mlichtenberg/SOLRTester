220 DR. M. KHALIL ON THE NEMATODE 

viviparous species of Parahronema living in the stomaoh-wall void 
 their embryos into the lymphatics or blood and not into the 
 intestinal canal. 

Super-family Strongvloidea Wienland, 1858. 

Family Strongylid^ Cobbold, 1864. 

Sub-family Strongylin^ E-ailliet, 1893. 

Genus Decrusia Lane, 1914. 

Fairly stout worms with a cup-shaped mouth capsule. There 
 is a marked duct of the dorsal oesophageal gland running along 
 the mid-dorsal line of the mouth capsule. 

Male : The dorsal ray is undivided except at its exti-eme tip. 
 The spicule?! are equal and similar, fine-pointed, and without 
 accessory piece. 

Female : The tail is blunt, the vulva is in the caudal third, the 
 uteri are divergent, the caudad-running uterus turning imme- 
 diately cephalad. 

Type-species, Decrusia additictia. 

Decrusia additictia Raill., Henry & Bauche, 1914. 

Strongylus additictus Rail]., Henry & Bauche, 1914. 

Decrusia decrusi Lane, 1914. 

Decrusia additicia Eaill., Henry &, Bauche, 1915. 

Decrusia additicia Lane, 1915. 

Strongylus additicius Ihle, 1919. 

This species has the characteristics of the genus. The mouth 
 capsule is tilted dorsally. The external leaf-crown consists of 
 140-150 rays. Male is 14 mm. long and LO mm. maximum 
 diameter. The spicules are 2'4mm. long. Female is 15 mm. 
 long and 1*4 mm. maximum diameter. The tail is 0-3 mm. long, 
 blunt at the tip. The vulva is 7-3 mm. from the tip of the tail. 
 The ova are 75 /x long by 40^ broad. 

Ihle thinks that this genus is an unjustifiable division of the 
 genus Strongylus. Although there are points of similarity 
 between the two genera, the dorsal tilt of the mouth-opening, 
 the long dorsal ray of the bursa, and the absence of an accessory 
 piece ma,ke this genus justifiable. In the genus Strongylus itself, 
 it was suggested by Looss thnt *S'. vulgaris, which is more allied 
 to S. equinus the type-species than Decrusia additictia, might 
 eventually prove to belong to another genus. 

Habitat. Large intestines of the Indian elephant (India). 

Genus MuRSHiDiA Lane, 1914. 

Lane's diagnosis of the genus runs as follows : â€” " Fairly slender 
 worms tapering towards the head end. The male is widest just
