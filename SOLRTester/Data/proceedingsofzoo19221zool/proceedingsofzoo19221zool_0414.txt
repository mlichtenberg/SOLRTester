on the other hand, says that it fits into a groove in tlie latter. 
 It is possible that, in the spirit specimens 1 ha,ve examined, the 
 ridge is conti'acted and drawn away from the roof of the pallial 
 cavit}". 

In the first place it is unfortunate that we can have no direct 
 evidence on this subject. In a living animal we are obviously 
 unable to see whether the pallial roof is in contact with the entire 
 length of the ridge. We have, therefore, to fall back upon in- 
 direct evidence. I'he following facts appear to indicate that the 
 separation is not complete. The ridge is sometimes quite high 
 enough anteriorly to touch the roof of the cavity ; but it almost 
 invariably decreases in height posterioily so that it is difficult to 
 see how complete insulation of the two chambers can be thereby 
 eflfected. Secondly, I have never found a groove deep enough to 
 hold the top of the ridge stead}?- against the j)i'essure of water. 
 Thirdly, I have frequently found the albumen gland so much 
 distended that it jn^esses down a portion of the ridge and keeps 
 the pallial roof a.way from it, thus opening a more complete 
 communication between the two cavities. Fii:ially, there can be 
 no actual need to prevent water from entering the so-called pul- 
 monary pallial cavity from the side of the gill, as it may be seen 
 frequently entering it from the left-hand side. It is, perhaps,, 
 from this latter fact that we ma}- derive an explanation of the 
 function of the ridge. Water apparently enters the pallial cavity 
 from the left-hand side, passes backwards, and then is passed 
 forwards over the gill to be finally discharged from the right-hand 
 side. It seems likely that the ridge functions in guiding the- 
 current of water, and its structure ( usually high anteriorly and 
 diminishing in size posteriorly) is in accordance with such a 
 function. The criticism will at once suggest itself that similar 
 arrangements for directing the cui'rent of water in branchial 
 respiration are not found in the large assemblage of other Proso- 
 branchs which employ branchial respiration. Difficult as this, 
 .argument may be, it appears to offer less obstacles to a solution 
 thaii the fact that a, similar ridge is found in Yivipara in which 
 no lung is found ! 

The function of the ridge in that genus has been discussed by 
 Sewell (9), who regards it as ' respiratory,' though he does not 
 make its precise r61e clear. The possibility that the ridge may 
 form part of a gutter down which the renal excretions pass to 
 J^he exterior should not be overlooked. Bouvier (2) suggests that 
 it acts in this capacity in AonpuUaria, as a result of the displace- 
 ment of the gill into the area of renal excretion. It should not 
 be overlooked, however, that the ridge is foiuid in Vlvijxtra in 
 which there is a, fully-formed ureter as well ! 

B. The next point of interest is whether during siphonal 
 respiration there is a direct coimection between the base of the 
 siphon on its inner side and the orifice of the lung. It must be 
 admitted in advance that the evidence to be adduced is mainly
