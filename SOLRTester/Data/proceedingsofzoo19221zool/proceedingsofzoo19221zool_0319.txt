the anterior part of the oesophagus from the level of the nerve 
 collar to the mouth collar. They are placed in the submedian 
 planes. Each has a long, thick duct, which can be traced easily 
 to the level of the groove separating the mouth collar from the 
 body. As has been mentioned already, probably these ducts 
 open on the top of the submedian head papillte. Their contents 
 are big granules in the centre, surrounded by fine granules which 
 also fill the ducts. 

CEsophagus. — There is a shallow oesophageal funnel sur- 
 rounded hy a thick chitinous Avail. The lumen of the 
 anterior -07 mm. of the oesophagus is ridged, having a 
 plumose appearance similar to that seen in P. africana. The 
 rest of the lumen of the oesophagus is "4 mm. in length and

•14 mm. maximum diameter. It is slightly constricted at 
 the site of the nerve collar. The caudal termination of the 
 oesophagus projects into the lumen of the chyle intestine, 
 forming three small lobes. 

Chyle intestine. — The cellular wall of the chyle intestine is 
 pigmented throughout its entire course. It pursues a nearly 
 straight course. 

Rectum. — This is a short tubular structure, Avith chitinous 
 wall sharply demarcated from the rest of the intestine. 

Excretory system. — The excretory vesicle is large and oblong. 
 The short excretory ducts open in the median ventral line 
 •72 mm. from the cephalic extremity.
