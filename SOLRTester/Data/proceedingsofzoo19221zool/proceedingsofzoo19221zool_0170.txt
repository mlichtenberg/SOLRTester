outlines are not visible in it, and there are numerous lightly 
 staining nuclei (w.) ; there are also many yellow granules 
 resembling chloragogen, often aggregated into considerable 
 masses (a-.). Blood-vessels (b.v.) traverse the cavity ; in some 
 cases the chloragogen-like granules are in — and indeed block — 
 the blood-vessels. 

The male funnel is a region of high columnar epithelium (/".) 
 surrounding the exit of the vas deferens from the sac ; the cells 
 are exceptionally high near the opening of the vas, and become 
 lower by degrees at the periphery of the patch ; their nuclei are 
 much elongated, and are placed at or above the middle of the 
 height of the cells. The vas deferens (r. def.) after emerging is 
 attached in numerous closely-set short loops on the posterior side 
 of the septum. 

The testis (i,) is a cellular proliferation just anterior to the 
 opening of the vas deferens ; it is thus implanted actually on the 
 funnel. Its attachment is narrow, but the cell-mass spreads out 
 considerably inside the sac. Near its attachment the nuclei are 
 small, and stain deeply ; in the middle portion of the organ the 
 nuclei are closely packed, with the chromatin in discrete rounded 
 particles ; more peripherally, cell outlines, which are wanting in 
 the more central (or proximal) parts of the testis, appear ; and 
 lastly, discrete cells are detached from the surface of the organ. 
 There were no ripe, or even ripening, spermatozoa in the sacs (the 
 Moniligastridse are apparently characterized by a seasonal sexual 
 maturity, like the Limicola?, and unlike most earthworms ; the 
 clitellum, for example, is often absent or very poorly marked) ; 
 moreover, it is pretty evident that the pinkly staining mass, with 
 small lightly staining nuclei, which fills out the gi'eater part of 
 the sac, is not directly concerned in the formation of spermatozoa. 

(3) The Prostates. 

There already exist a number of observations on the structure 
 of the prostates in the genus Drawicla, but these are not concor- 
 dant throughout. The lining epithelium, the layer of muscular ■ 
 fibres, and the " gland cells " are distinguished in all descriptions; 
 but authors are not agreed as to whether the gland cells are to 
 be referred to the peritoneal or to the epithelial layer. 

Beddard, in a first communication on D. harwelli (2), states 
 that outside the layer of muscular fibi-es there is a layer of pecu- 
 liarly modified peritoneal cells. In a later account (3) this 
 glandular tissue is described as consisting of large granular cells 
 separated into groups by partitions ; each cell is prolonged into a 
 fine process, which extends at least as far as the muscular wall ; 
 indeed, says the author, it is difficult to believe that the cells do 
 not in some way or other reach the lumen of the atrium and 
 there discharge their secretion. Nevertheless, this layer of gland 
 cells is the modified peritoneal layer, and there is no peritoneal 
 coat outside it.
