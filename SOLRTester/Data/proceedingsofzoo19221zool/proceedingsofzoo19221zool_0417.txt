MECUANISJI OF THE AJIPULLARIIDyE. 345 

Pachylahra, though an intUvidnal feature is seen in the develop- 
 ment of an upraised ridge on the right-liand edge. The orifice is 
 ahiiost as long as in Fachylabra, but in the two species examined 
 it does not extend so far backwards. 

It is impossible as yet to discuss tlie course of evolution in the 
 AmpullariidsB. It would seem, however, that the method of 
 respiration and the structure of the siphon and the respiratory 
 orifice exhibit a correlated a.nd progressive modification. At first 
 the siphon is short and almost functionless, the respiratory orifice 
 elongate. Then the siphon acquires aii intimate association with 
 the left-hand side of the pallial aperture which it assists to close 
 during siphonal respiration. It increases in length and can 
 become completely tubular. The i-espiratory orifice becomes 
 restricted in size and anteiior in position and possibly more 
 directly .approximated to the base of the siphon. 

D. The development of .the lung-cavity * from the branchial 
 chamber in the AmpullariidtB is comparable to the similar 
 phenomenon in Birgus latro and the terrestrial Brachyura and in 
 certain gobiid fishes, and the amphibious habits of these animals 
 are in general alike. Semper (8) and others have dealt with the 
 causes which may lead to the development of the amphibious 
 habit, so that there is no need to discuss this ma,tter in detail. 
 It might be pointed out that in the case of AmjmUaria the 
 development of a lung is apparently not necessarily connected 
 with the periodic drying-upof the sti-eams a.nd the sheets of Avater 
 in which the molluscs live. Amjndlaria, to judge from numerous 
 observations, is capable of spending a long period in a state of 
 reduced metabolism familiar to all students of molluscan aesti- 
 vation. This process is of course facilitated in operculate forms 
 by the retention of moisture in the tissues owing to the comjDlete 
 insulation of the animal by the operculum. The methods by 
 which the Ampullariidas are able to resist the annual periods of 
 desiccation are, therefore, probably the same as that of other tropical 
 molluscs. The significance of the development of the siphon is 
 quite a different matter. The development of the siphon is 
 probably coi-related with an increased tendency to live in streams 
 covered with a dense mat of surface vegetation in which the 
 short siphonal forms could not exist. In drawing attention to a 
 possible adaptationai value of the siphon, I do not Avish to assert 
 that it was necessarily adaptive in its origin, 

I am indebted to my friend Dr. Baini Prashad of the Zoological 
 Survey of India for permission to state that, so far as Pachylahra 
 is concerned, his views (arrived at independently) with regard to 
 the adaptationai value of the long siphon are the same as those 
 advanced above. 

* It is interesting to note tliat Brooks and McGlone (4), who have studied the 
 development of the North American A. depressa,^r\6L that the lung-cavity is de- 
 veloped as an infolding between the ridges from which the gill and osphradium 
 are developed, all three structures arising from practically the same area in the 
 embryonic mantle-cavity.
