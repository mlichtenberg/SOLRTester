SPIDERS FROM SOUTH ANNAM. 287 

The front laterals are their diameter distant from their 
 median. 

The clypeus is one and a half times longer than the median 
 eye-area and perpendicular. 

The mandil)les are conical, one and a half times as long as they 
 are broad at the base ; the fangs sliort and stout. 

The lip is longer than broad, rounded anteriorly, three-fourths 
 the height of the maxilles. The latter bend over the lip and are 
 convex, not at all impressed. 

The sternum is shield-shaped, truncate anteriorly, H times as 
 long as broad, rounded at the posterior end, but not protruding 
 between the rear coxafi, which are rather wide apart. 

The abrlomen is ovate, broader in front than at the rear, 
 rounded at the sides. At the posterior end on the under side is a 
 transverse row of short spines in front of thfe spinnerets. Of 
 these the inferior are cylindrical, raised on a membranous 
 base, with a short 2nd joint. They stand close together. 
 Tlie superior are similar, but half as long and only half the 
 diameter, standing farther apart. The epigyne consists of two 
 oval depressions, their length apart, with another shallow hollow 
 above each. 

The legs are long and fine, the joints cylindrical, with a few 
 scattered hairs along the outer sides, and short weak spines on 
 all joints except the tarsal. Near the distal end of the metatarsal 
 is a thick bunch of spinous bristles. The tarsal joints of the 2nd 
 and 3rd pairs (the others broken) are three-fourths the length of 
 the metatarsal. The claws are two, with about six pectinations, 
 and spring from a short onychium. 

The measurements in millimetres are as follows: â€”
