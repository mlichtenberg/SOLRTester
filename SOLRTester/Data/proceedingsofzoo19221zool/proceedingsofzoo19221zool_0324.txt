The venti-ivl ray is bifurcated in its terminal half. The two 
 branches lie close together. The anteiior branch is thinner than 
 the posterior. 

The three lateral lays have a common origin. The j^osjtero- 
 lateral ray branches before the other two i-aj^s. All three r;xys 
 lie close to each other throughout their entire course. Their 
 terminal third is folded inside the bursa. 

Tlie externo-dorsal ray is slender, and pursues a curved course. 
 It does not reach the edge of the bursa, but ends by a, jxipilla on 
 the external surface. 

The dorsal ray is unique in virtue of its enormous length. It 
 measures 1"67 mm., and divides high up within "15 mm. of 
 its origin. After a short coui-se each primary division gives off

a long and a short branch lying close to each other. The 
 longer branch is '12 mm. and. the shorter -05 mm. in length. 
 These branches appear as oflshoots from the main stem, which 
 continues a straight course, parallel and close to the corre- 
 sponding ray of the other brnnch. Both end in a sharp point. 

Genital cone. â€” The cloacal opening is placed near the apex of 
 an elongated genital cone. The cone projects fiom the roof 
 of the bursa between the pre-bursal papilte. It is placed 
 ventrally and caudally, and is 'IS mm. in length and '04 miri. in 
 breadth. The cloaca! canal traverses its centre. Its opening 
 is overlapped by its projecting anterior lip, which forms the 
 apex of the cone.
