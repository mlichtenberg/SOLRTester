would exteiul ov<^r a niuch larger area, and the low-level forest 
 assemblages would extend over thousands of square miles now 
 oidv tenanted by dwarfed trees of species which can survive the 
 long droughts. Consequently the ai-eas of open grass lands so- 
 necessaiy to many species would be restricted. 

All this must have had a profound effect on the wild game of 
 those times and on its distribution. The low forest, for instance, 
 now only survives in a few favoured spots such as the delta of the 
 Lumi Kiver near Taveta, the banks of the Tana, and on a few 
 isohited areas near the coast, b;it traces of its existence are to be 
 found over a great extent of country, and ithese remnants are 
 evidence of its greater extension. 

Piecing together the few facts I have quoted regarding distri- 
 bution, I premise that Kenya Colony may be looked upon as the: 
 junction or the tei'mination of three zoological areas : — The West 
 Coast area, the Somaliland area, and South-East African area. 
 The West Coast area officially terminates at Riiwenzori Mountain, 
 but traces of its fauna are still found far east of that mountain,, 
 in country Avliich they invaded during the period of maximum 
 afibrestation before referred to, a variety of the West African 
 potto { Perodictlcus) being found as far east as Kakumega Forest,, 
 wdiich is 50 miles east of Lake Victoria. The bongo is also a 
 West African type, the butterflies of Kavirondo and West Nandi 
 also contain many West African types, and the grey parrot of 
 W. Africa comes as far as the iSTandi Forest, and is very occasion- 
 ally seen as far east as Kikuyu. 

As regards the Somaliland fauna, I look upon AValler's gazelle 
 as the type-sjiiecies illustrating the invasion from the north, it is 
 (|uite common on the north and east side of the Tana, but much 
 rarer at its southern limit ; Grevy's zebra is another example, and 
 possibly the lesser kudu. The greater kudu is a puzzle because 
 it is fairly common in parts of Somaliland, and common in parts 
 of South Afiica, but very rare in Kenya. 

With regard to the South-East Africa area, the sa,ble antelope 
 undoubtedly worked its way up the East coast from Portuguese 
 East Africa, and I am inclined to believe that the wildebeest 
 also came north from South Afi'ica, developing new characteristics 
 on the journey. 

The original focus of distribution of the bubalines, which in- 
 clude the various forms of hartebeest, is very difficult to settle, 
 but they possibly originated and split up into varieties in this- 
 area, for more hartebeest probably exist in it than in any other, 
 and the forms are more numerous. 

Game axd Disease.— Although, of course, there are many keen 
 sportsmen in the Colony, there is a strong local feeling against 
 Avild game among a section of farmers, who believe that it 
 spreads the tsetse-flies and thus increases the area afi'ected by 
 trypanasomiasis. They again argue that game fosters the supply
