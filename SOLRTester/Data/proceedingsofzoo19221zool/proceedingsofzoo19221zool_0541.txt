apposed to each other to the rim of the bursa. The postero-lateral 
 and medio-lutei'al rays are also equal in size, and pass to the edge 
 of the bursa closely parallel to each other. The externo-iateral 
 ray diverges from the other lateral rays, so that eventually its tip 
 is about one-third of the distance between the medio-lateral and 
 latero-ventral rays. From the main trunk of the dorsal ray, about 
 half-way between its root and its bifurcation, the externo-dorsal 
 ray takes its origin ; it also passes into the lateral bursal lobe, 
 but terminates a short distance from the margin of the bursa. 
 The dorsal ray supports the median lobe of the bursa. Its base

is stout and about 56 //. in diameter, but after the origin of the 
 externo-dorsal ray it is only about half this breadth. It is about 
 230 jn long and bifurcates at its middle, and each branch so 
 formed bears on its outer margin a short, somewhat elbowed 
 branch which is slightly thicker than the I'est of the main 
 branch. 

The spicules (text-fig. 5 a) are long and tubular, and are 
 protruded some considerable distance in almost all the males 
 obtained. They are similar and of equal length, measuring 
 1-29 mm. long, more or less straight, and both end in a sharp point.
