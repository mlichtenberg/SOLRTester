[Received March 24, 1922 : Head April 25, 1922.] 

The opisthoglyphous snake and lacertid lizard here described 
 occurred in collections of re})tiles made in East Africa during 
 1920. 

In naming this new snake after Miss J. Procter, F.Z.S., I wish 
 to testify to her kindness in examining the dentition of this and 
 other specimeniS and in reading over the proofs. My thanks are 
 also due to Mr. G. A. Boulenger, F.R.S., for making a correction 
 in the description of the new lizard. 

GeODIPSAS PROCTERS, Sp. 11. 

If included in this genus (Blgr. Cat. Snakes, iii. p. 32), to which 
 it is closely allied, the generic description will have to be 
 enlarged to include snakes with single as well as double sub- 
 caudals. 

Dentition. — 16 or 17 maxillary teeth (including the fangs). 
 Solid teeth followed after a slight interspace by two enlarged 
 grooved fangs. Mandibular teeth subequal. 

Description. — Rostral broader than deep, just visible from 
 above ; internasals as long as broad, shorter than praefrontals ^ 
 frontal once and a half as long as broad, shorter than its 
 distance from end of snout, shorter than the parietals ; loreal as 
 long as deep : three prse- and two postoculars ; temporals one 
 plus two ; eight upper labials, fourth and fifth entering the eye ; 
 four lower labials in contact with the anterior chin-shields, 
 which are a little shorter than the posterior. Scales in seventeen 
 rows. Yentrals 148 ; anal single ; subcaudals 49, single. 

Coloration. — Purplish iridescent black above, slightly paler 
 beneath. Throat white. Head brownish ; labials white, with a 
 brownish mark on the posterior border of each ; an ill-defined 
 black stripe from posterior border of eye to commissure of mouth, 
 crossing 7tli and 8th labials. A distinct black dorsal stripe on 
 median row of scales from frontal to end of body ; indistinct 
 on tail. 

Sex S 

Length of head and body 310 mm. 
 ,, ,, tail 76 mm. 

Affinities. — Very similar in all respects to Geodipsas vauero- 
 cegce Tornier, 1902, from which it differs in having 3 instead 
 of 2 pra30culars, smaller parietal shields, and single subcaudals. 

Locality. — On pach in thick bush-country, Uluguru Mts., 
 3 miles from Morogoi'O, T. T., at an altitude of about 3000 ft. ; 
 1. iii. 1921.
