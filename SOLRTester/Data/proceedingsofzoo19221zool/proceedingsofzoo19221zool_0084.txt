very weakly developed and shows only occasionally a projecting 
 needle. 

7. Other spicitles. Those of the sterile stalk are almost en- 
 tirely small, star-shaped forms. In the foliaceous collar we find 

(1) large, curved, almost smooth spindles up to 5 mm. in length; 

(2) quaint, flattened forms, like biscuit-fingers in shape, not 
 exceeding 1 mm. ; (3) the small red, rough spicules of the antho- 
 codia ; and (4) the tiny, flat, jagged ones of the tentacles. 

Salient Features : — The peculiar mode of growth (Avhich seems 
 to be unique), the limpness of the whole colony, the length of the 
 polyp stalks. 

I refer my specimens to D. clavata, although Kiikenthal's 
 description does not mention any growth peculiarity such as has 
 been noted here. The important points of agreement are the 
 following : — 

(1) a glomerate mode of branching (Glomeratse), with the polyp- 

bearing twigs predominating over the stem and main 
 branches in building up the polyparium (hemprichi 
 group); . _ _ 

(2) a primitive anthocodial armature with 7-8 (D. clavata 

10-12) pairs of very uniform, short, rod-like spindles in 
 each point ; no distinct crown ; 

(3) a very weakly developed supporting bundle which only 

occasionally shows a projecting needle ; 

(4) a long polyp stalk of from 1-2 mm, (about 1 mm. in 

D. clavata) ; 

(5) a well-developed foliaceous collar ; 

(6) an almost exclusive occurrence of small, plump stars and 

double stars in the cortex of the sterile stalk ; 

(7) a practically complete absence of spicules from the canal- 

walls. With agreements so numerous it seems entirely 
 justifiable to disregard the extraordinary growth pecu- 
 liarities. 
 Locality : — Station 302. 

2. Dendronephthya gigantea (Verr.). (Plate II.) 

Described by Verrill, Bull. Mus. Comp. Zool. Cambridge, p. 40 
 (1864). 

Diagnosis : — Glomerate ; with numerous rounded, polyp- 
 bearing masses, the lowest branches slightly foliaceous ; polyps 
 densely arranged in characteristic hemispherical masses ; polyp 
 stalks short, under 1 mm. ; supporting bundle very strong ; point 
 spicules very variable, 1-6 pairs ; no crown ; grade IV. ; spicules 
 of the upper cortex are large (4 mm.), covered with blunt warts 
 and lie transversely, lower cortex and canal-walls have stouter 
 and shorter spindles, triradiates and multiradiates ; colour : cortex 
 white, polyps deep orange.
