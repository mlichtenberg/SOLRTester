Descriptive Notes : â€” 

1. Colony as a lohole. Yeiy handsome umbellate colony with 
 profuse root-work ; hardlj^ visible sterile stalk ; much branched 
 and, in its general aspect, distinctly flattened polyparium. It is 
 32 cm. in maximum height and 40 cm. in maximum breadth, 
 with an approximate thickness of. 6 cm. The contour of the 
 whole colony is markedly interi'upted. 

2. Branching. There is a general division into three strong 
 branches each of which tends to lose the flattened aspect, 
 broadening out into an exuberant corymbose head. The polyp- 
 bearing twigs are distinct umbels. There are no definite large 
 hemispherical bunches. Large areas on the branches are bare 
 and exposed. The basal branches are foliaceous, but do not form 
 a complete circle. The main branches give off numerous second- 
 ary and tertiary branches, which eventually break up in fairly 
 regular dichotomy into minor corymbs which bring the crowded 
 polyps more or less up to one level. 

3. Colouring. The exposed areas on the branches are covered 
 with irregularly scattered spindles, visible to the naked eye and 
 giving the surface a glistening white appearance. On the twigs 
 are large orange and crimson spindles, standing out conspicu- 
 ously against the general white of the cortex. There seems to be 
 no regularity in the distribution of the two colours, except that 
 any one group of twigs is either orange or crimson. The 
 supporting bundles are also either orange or crimson, but the 
 polyp spicules are white.

4. Polyp stalks are very short. 

5. Polyps. The polyps themselves occur in small bundles of 
 7-12, and the stalk of each bundle is long. 

6. Polyp spicules. The anthocodial armature consists of about 
 8 pairs of spicules en chevron on each of the eight points, all 
 practically of the same size, about 0-13 mm. Below the point
