CHARACTEKS OF SOME HVSTKICOMORPII RODE>"TS. 405 

outside the limits of tlie Dasyproctidte and Caviidje, namely, in 
 Ociodon and Ctenomys, where they ai-e of large size, and in 
 Acanthion and Erethizon, where they are short. I do not know 
 what the explanation of these differences may be. Probably, 
 however, these spikes are only fvdly developed in mature males ; 
 but, since my examples of Dolichotis and Hydrochoerus were fully 
 mature, it also occurs to me as a possibility that they may be 
 broken off during copulation and reproduced subsequently. Also 
 I do not know what their function may be, unless it is to 
 penetrate the orifices of the Fallopian tubes, either to make a 
 passage for the semen or, if shed, to block the oiifices after the 
 introduction of the semen. However that may be, one thing is 
 clear, namely, that the presence of these spikes in such widely 
 separated genera as Acanthion, Erethizon, and Octodon does away 
 with their importance as evidence of kinsliip between such genera 
 as Dasyprocta, Coelogenys, and Cavia. 

One other point to note is that the testes never pass into a 
 scrotum in the Hystiicomorpha. 

The penis of Hystrix and Acanthion is retrospective, when at 
 rest, being bent backwards on itself so that the prepuce forms a 
 swelling a little beneath the anus. When erected the penis pro- 
 trudes a long way from the prepuce and projects forwar ds. It is 
 furnished with an apical baculum. The orifice, when dilated, 
 reveals two apertures, an upper and smaller one immediately 
 beneath the tip of the baculum and a lower one forming a trans- 
 verse slit which leads into a tolerably deep glandular pouch, with 
 puckered walls and a pair of small spikes at the bottom. This 
 pouch can be evaginated, and in this condition it projects well 
 beyond the normal tip of the penis. It can be withdrawn by the 
 action of a couple of tendons running backwards along the lower 
 half of the penis beneath the urethral canal. The epithelium of 
 this glandular pouch and of the penis itself is beset with minute 
 spicules, but the epithelium at the bottom of the pouch round 
 the tooth-like spikes is smooth. (Text-fig. 20, A-F.) 

According to Parsons (P. Z. S. 1894, pp. 251-296) the male 
 genitalia oi Atherura resemble those of Hystrix. 

In the male of Coendu novoi-hispanicv the penis opens at the 
 lower extremity of the naked area of skin common to it and the 
 anus, as described lielow (p. 417). When at rest the penis is 
 retrospective and completely withdrawn within a short naked 
 prepuce. The structure of the penis is almost exactly the same as 
 in Acanthion longicauda. The orifices of the urethra and of the 
 glandular sac are normally concealed by the epithelium at the 
 tip of the glans penis, but when this is spread the orifice of the 
 ui-ethra is exposed just beneath the tip of the baculum, with 
 that of the glandular pouch behind it. This pouch has longi- 
 tudinally corrugated walls and a pair of small spikes at the 
 bottom. (Text-fig. 20, G-K.) 

In Myocastor the penis opens retrospectively a little distance 
 below and in front of the anus and is normally entirely
