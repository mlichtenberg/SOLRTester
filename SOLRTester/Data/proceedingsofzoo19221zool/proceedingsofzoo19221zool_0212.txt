1 r)8 MR. C. TATE BEGAN ON THE 

in the livke from two ancestral types, Limiiotilwpia and llaplo- 
 chromis; but, although there are a number of genera Avhich 
 appear to be derived from Haplochromis, that genus itself is 
 represented by two species only. 

From Nyassa 84 Cichlida? belonging to 14 genera* have been 
 described, nearly all endemic. The most striking feature is the 
 pi'esence of 53 endemic species of Ilaplochromis, which appear to 
 form a natural group and have evidently evolved in the lake 
 from one or a few ancestral forms. Of the endemic genera four 
 (with 12 species) are evidently derived from forms closely related 
 to species of Haplochromis now living in the lake, and two more 
 [CynoUlapia, Pseudotropheus) are related to Haplochromis. Of 
 the others Hemitilapia and Otop)harynx are near Tilapla., CMlo- 
 tilapia is Otopharyvx specialized, and Coremalodus is mainly 
 distinguished from the endemic Tilcqna sqioamijnnnis hj its 
 mouth and dentition. The indications are that the endemic 
 Nj'assa Cichlids have originated in the lake from about half-a- 
 dozen ancestral forms. 

In Lake Victoria there are 50 species of Cichlidse, all peculiar 
 to the lake except Tilapia zillii, a Nilotic species. The endemic 
 species are a Tilajna, 44 Hcqjlochromis, and 4 monotypic genera 
 distinguished from Haplocliromis by peculiarities of the dentition, 
 or in one by an increased number of anal spines. 

The species of Haplochromis exhibit almost as great a diversity 
 as in Nyassa, yet there are certain features which enable one to 
 say almost at a glance to which lake a species belongs. In most 
 of the Nyassa Haplochromis the caudal fin is more or less 
 distinctly emarginate, and is covered Avith small scales in the 
 adult fish, whereas in most of the Victoria species it is rounded 
 or truncate and is scaly only in the basal half. In the Nyassa 
 Haplochromis a few distinctive types of coloration are prevalent â€” 
 for example, 15 species have a dark band on each side from nape 
 to caudal fin, and several others have four dark spots on each 
 side ; in most of the Victoria Haplochromis, when markings are 
 present, they take the form of regular dark ci'oss-bars with a 
 dark band from head to caudal fin and another above the lateral 
 line. 

There can be little doubt that Haplochromis cinereus, a small 
 species, with rather short decurved snout and moderately small 
 and slightly oblique mouth, is a generalized type ; species with 
 these characters are widely distributed in African rivers. A 
 number of species in Lake Victoria are closely related to 
 H. cinereus, but differ in the dentition of the jaws or of the 
 pharyngeals, in having thicker lips, more gill-rakers, a larger 
 eye, etc. 

Haplochromis serramis and its allies are somewhat larger 

* In my paper I recognized 15, but I no^ find that Astatotilapia cannot be 
 maintained as distinct from Ilaplochromis, several of tbe Lake Victoria species 
 having enhirged teeth at the ends of tbe priemaxillavies more or Jess developed and 
 not at all constant.
