Sterno- and Cleido- mastoid: — Both muscles are powerful, but 
 tliere is no gap between theui at any point. The former arises 
 from the anterior border of the nianul^rium sterni and margin of 
 the sternal end of the clavicle (text-fig. IDA, 8,M). The latter 
 originates from the inner fourth of the clavicle, and gradually 
 gains the deep surface of the sterno-mastoid. Both muscles are 
 inserted into the mastoid region and occipital crest. There is no 
 separate cleido-occipital. The spinal accessory nerve is deep to 
 both muscles. In some Primates there is no clavicular fascicle. 

The omo-hyoid is fiat, thin, undivided into bellies, and has no 
 central tendon. The hyoid and scapular attachments show 
 nothing peculiar, but there is no fascial connection to the 
 sternum. 

The pretracheal muscles show nothing peculiar.

The superficial anatomy of the side of the head, after the skin and platj'sma have 
 been removed. G.A.N : great auricular nerve ; O.N : occipital nerve ; S.]\I : 
 sterno-mastoid; P.G : parotid gland ; 0. A : occipital artery ; E.C.A : ectocarotid 
 artery; I. P.V : inferior labial vein; S.T.V : superficial temporal vein; E.J.V : 
 external jugular vein ; M.M : masseter muscle. 

The digastric belongs to Parson's first type (4), but no fascia 
 unites it to the hyoid bone. And there is no essential difference 
 between it and that in Macacus rhesus*. The posterior bellies 
 are very strong, and the tendinous arch is long and powerful. 

The stylo -mandihular ligament is partly ossified, and gives 
 origin to the stylo-hyoid muscle which is tunnelled by the inter- 
 mediate tendon of the digastic. The stylo-hyoid ligament, how- 
 ever, is not ossified. 

The mylo-hyoid is strong and thick, but its attachments show 
 nothing peculiar.
