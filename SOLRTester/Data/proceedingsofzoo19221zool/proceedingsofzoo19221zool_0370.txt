Type- specimen given to the British Museum. Only the type 
 was collected, and though I sent a native collector to the 
 same locality for a month for the express purpose of obtaining 
 more specimens, he failed to get any. 

JSTUCKAS KILOS.^, sp. n. 

Some lizards collected at Tindiga, Kilosa District, T. T., belong- 
 to an undescribed species. Tlie following description is based on 
 a series of seven individuals, six of which wei'e males. These 
 have been indicated by letters a to/', males; g, female: — 

Description. — Head moderate ; snout obtuse ; nostril pierced 
 between three shields ; nasals not or but slightly swollen, lower 
 separated from the i-ostral ; two praefrontals ; frontal feebly («, d) 
 or strongly (6, c) grooved ; four to six supraoculars (four in a, d ; 
 iive in h ; six in c), the two middle ones being much the largest 
 in a, the anterior two largest in 6, c ; interparietal at least twice 
 as long as broad, longer than the suture between the fronto- 
 parietals ; an enlarged band-like temporal shield and a curved 
 tympanic ; temporal scales granular, smooth, no auricular denticu- 
 lation ; lower eyelid scaly, subocular narrower below than above, 
 bordering the lip between the fourth and fifth up2:er labials ; two 
 or three anterior pairs of chin-shields in contact. Gular scales 
 gradually increasing in size towards the collar; latter slightly 
 ■curved, perfectly free, formed of nine (rai-ely seven as in d) plates. 
 Dorsal scales rhomboidal, juxtaposed, keeled, 42 to 56 across the 
 middle of the body. Ventral plates in 6 or 8 longitudinal, and 
 27 to 31 transverse series. The hind-limb reaches tlie wrist 
 {h, e, d), elbow (e), or axilla {a) in the male, and the elbow in the 
 female type. Foot as long as, or a little longer than, the head. 
 A single (occasionally double) series of large subtibial plates. 
 JEleven to thirteen femoral pores (11 in J a, $^; 12 in 6 6 h,d; 
 13 in c). Tail nearly {a, e) or more than twice (5) the length of 
 head and body in male, much more than twice the length in 
 female type ; caudal scales strongly keeled except basal sub- 
 caudals, which are obtusely keeled. 

Coloration in life. — (S . Upper surface of head, fore-limbs, and 
 body nearly to hind-limbs brown. Head, limbs, and upper sur- 
 face of tail a bright yet translucent red, which entirely disappears 
 on preservation. A narrow, yellow, vertebral line commences at 
 interparietal ; it lies between a pair of dorso-lateral lines which 
 start from the band-like temporal scale ; these three lines all 
 vanish on the base of tail ; the space between these dorso-laterals 
 and the vertebral line is dotted and marbled with black spots, 
 Avhich are sometimes almost absent in parts and in others 
 confluent in black patches, or form a black border to the vertebi'al 
 line. A single (sometimes double) series of yellow dots and 
 dashes on flanks ; below these a white or yellowish line com- 
 mencing at commissure of mouth- passes through the ear-opening 
 and may be continuous to hind-limb, but is more frequently
