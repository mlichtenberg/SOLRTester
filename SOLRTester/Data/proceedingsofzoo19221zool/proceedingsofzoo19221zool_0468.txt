The claws and pads on these three digits and on the fifth are 
 well developed, the pads being smooth. The plantar pad is very 
 different from that of Gcelogeiiys, consisting of two elements 
 opposite the interdigital spaces of the three main digits. The 
 third, or outer, element of this pad is small and circular, and has 
 accompanied the backward migration of the fifth digit. The 
 carpal pads, two in number, are narrow, indistinct behind, and in 
 contact mesially, the inner pad being larger than the outer and 
 projecting further distally. They are separated by a longish 
 area of naked skin from the plantar pad. The inner side of the 
 wrist is covered with short hair, sometimes almost naked, as in 
 Coilogenys. (Text-fig. 13, 0.) 

The hind foot is like that of Coelogenys, except that the fii'st 
 and fifth digits have entirely disappeared, the three main digits 
 axe longer, thinner, and miwebbed, the plantar pad is much 
 smaller, consisting of two larger but small pads at the base of 
 the inner and median digits, and of a very small circular pad 
 at the base of the fourth or outer digit. Assuming this pad 
 to be the homologue of the small pad at the base of the fifth digit 
 in Coelogenys, it occupies a very difierent position. The meta- 
 tarsal pad is a long way behind the plantar pad, and shows at 
 most indistinct signs of a divisional line on its inner side. (Text- 
 fig. 13, D.) 

The feet of Olmichilla are derivable from tlie type seen in 
 Ccelogenys, with the basal webbing eliminated. In the fore foot 
 the digits are thinner, with relatively larger compressed pads 
 and shoi'ter claws adapted to a life amongst rocks, but their 
 number, relative length, and disposition are similar. There is a 
 distinctly three-lobed plantar pad and a large two-lobed carpal 
 pad, which, however, is larger than the plantar pad and not 
 smaller as in Ccelogenys. The wrist, however, is uniformly 
 covered above and laterally with long hairs. The hind foot is 
 longer and thinner, and the hallux has entirely disappeared ; but 
 the remaining four digits are similarly placed, although, as in 
 the front foot, they have relatively broader pads and much 
 shorter claws. The plantar pad is two-lobed, its external element, 
 larger than in Coelogenys, has travelled up the foot in company 
 with the fifth digit and lies laterally nearly midway l^etween the 
 plantar and metatarsal pads, the latter being defined by a sulcus 
 which expands into a notch distally. A specialisation is the 
 development of fringes of longer hairs on the inner sides of 
 the second and third digits, those on the second forming a stiff 
 comb. (Text-fig. 14, A, B.) 

In general features the feet of Lagidhim ai-e like those of 
 Chinchilla^ except that the under sides of all the digits, apart from 
 the digital pads, are thicklj^ covered with hairs and the digital 
 pads themselves are compressed and furnished, as in Cerodon, 
 with a rounded median keel. The three elements of the plantar 
 pad of the fore foot are very large and in contact. Behind these
