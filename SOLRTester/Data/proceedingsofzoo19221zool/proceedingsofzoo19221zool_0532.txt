MK. R. BROOM OX THE PERSISTENCE OF THE 

curtilage lies between the basipterygoid pi-ocess and the pterygoid. 
 This is the meniscus pterygoideus of Howes and Swinnerton, and 
 the element whose affinities we wish to examine. It is rather 
 longer than the face of the basipterygoid process, and, as will be 
 seen in the cross-sections given, it is of considerable thickness. 
 It completely sepaiates the pterygoid from the basisphenoid, so 
 that no part of the pterygoid is in contact with the basicranial 
 cartilage. Further, the " meniscus " has no direct relations with 
 the epipterygoid, the ptei-ygoid completely separating the one 
 from the other. To a considerable extent it is clasped by the

Base of skull of embryo Agama hispida var. aculeata. Head lengtli 7 mm. Recon- 
 structed from sections. On the right side, parts of the vomer (parasphenoid)j 
 basipter3'goid process, and of the pterj-goid have been removed ; and a full view 
 is given of the mesopterj'goid.

pterygoid, and the movement at the joint is between the 
 "meniscus" and the basipterygoid process and not between 
 the pterygoid and the " meniscus." In fact, it is pretty manifest 
 from the examination of this embryo alone that the element is 
 reallj^ a pterygoid element. 

The reconstruction of the base of the skull in this Agama 
 embryo shows a very interesting condition of the median basal 
 bony element which the large majority of morphologists call the 
 parasphenoid, but which I regard as the true homologue of the 
 mammalian vomer. Besides neai'ly covering over the pituitary
