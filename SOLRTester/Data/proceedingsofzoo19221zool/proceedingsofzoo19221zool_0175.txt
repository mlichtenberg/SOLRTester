septa 10/11 a-ncl 11/12 only a single septum, wliicli is to be 
 regarded as a product of the fusion of the two. More ventrally 
 these separate, so that in a longitudinal section taken to one side 
 of the alimentary canal, segm. xi appears as a wedge-like space 
 with its apex upwards and base at the parietes. This wedge- 
 like space is continuous above the alimentary canal with the 
 similar space on the other side. 

There are, however, other complications in the form of this 
 chamber which are difficult to describe in a few words. If the 
 above were a complete description, it is obvious that segm. xi 
 would be an ordinary segment, except that its hounding septa 
 would be fused dorsally ; and it would contain a section of the 
 alimentary tube, doisal and ventral vessels, and ventral nerve 
 cord. What actually happens may be described by saying that 
 {a) throughout the whole of the gizzard and reproductive regions 
 of the worm the septa are incomplete in their mid-ventral por- 
 tions — around the ventral vessel and ventral nerve cord — as if a 
 series of arches were cut out of them ; (b) that all round the 
 alimentary canal, between septa 10/11 and 11/12, a ring-shaped 
 partition isolates an annular coelomic space (figs, 4 & 6, ann.) 
 round the tube ; this annular cavity contains also the dorsal 
 vessel {d.v.), but the ventral vessel is below it ; (c) longitudinal 
 and almost vertical partitions are also established, extending in 
 the ventro-lateral region between septa 10/11 and 11/12, and thus 
 isolating the mid-ventral portion of the coslomic cavity here 
 (fig. 6, v.ch.). 

The cavity of segm. xi is thus altogether absent dorsally ; and 
 what exists of it is divided up as follows : — (i.) An annular space 
 immediately surrounding the alimentary canal and containing 
 also the dorsal vessel ; (ii.) a larger space, the ovarian chamber 
 (figs. 4 & 6, o.c), surrounding this in turn, of which (iii.) the 
 mid-ventral portion is isolated by longitudinal partitions on 
 each side of the ventral vessel and ventral nerve cord, but is 
 continuous in front and behind with the ccelomic cavities of 
 neighbouring segments *. 

The ovarian chamber contains the ovaries with their funnels, 
 and the nephridia. The ovisac (fig. 4, sac) is an evagination of 
 its posterior wall. The ovaries are proliferations of the epithelium 
 covering the anterior wall of the chamber. The funnels ( /") are 
 constituted by modifications of the epithelium of the posterior 
 wall. 

The walls of the chamber have the usual constitution of 
 septa — peritoneum on the outside, muscular and connective 
 tissue composing their substance. The inside of the chamber is 

* There are other peculiarities of the septa in the neighbouring regions which are 
 diiScult to make out. Thus the floor of the annular chamber round the gut in 
 segm. xi is continued forward and backward as a sheet of tissue whicli extends from 
 behind the gizzard region to the spefmatliecal segment. This sheet maj^ have free 
 Literal margins, or the lateral margins may be bent upwards to join the ventro-lateral 
 wall of the cesophagus.
