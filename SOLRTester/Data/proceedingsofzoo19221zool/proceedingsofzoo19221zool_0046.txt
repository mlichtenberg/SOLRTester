made permanent sanctuaries for the big game. An improvement 
 of the water-supply will, for instance, do a great deal to anchor 
 the game to their Reserves. 

The fencing of the portion of the Game Reserves which abuts 
 on the settled areas will eventually have to be undertaken, and 
 this is a serious matter, for it will cost a considerable sum to 
 erect, and annual sums for maintenance. 

The relation of the tsetse-fly and ticks to game needs further 
 investigation by trained observers, and it is, I think, important 
 that a biological station should be founded in the main Reserve 
 with a research zoologist in charge, and this should be the centre 
 for detailed investigation into the life-history of the game 
 animals, the problems of distribution, the disea.ses of game, and 
 the bionomics of insect life, with particular attention to the 
 "tsetses and ticks. Attention should also be given to locust ex- 
 termination, for the desti-uction of lai'ge areas of grazing by these 
 insects profoundly affects the game, and when the locusts spread 
 to the farms, they lead to losses and consequent grievances. For 
 a, similar reason attention should be directed to the destruction 
 of the myriads of larvae of a butterfly, of the genus Belenois, 
 which periodically destro3''s large areas of grazing in the Reserves 
 and elsewhere. 

The Game Department should otficially photograph the game 
 in their natural haunts, both by telephoto apparatus and film 
 cameras ; the rangers have opportunities of seeing game under 
 •conditions denied to most. A series of photographs would form 
 a very valuable record, and also prove of service for educational 
 purposes. The Department should also collect from time to time 
 series of heads of the various species for our national collections, 
 ■ixnd a complete reference collection for the local museum. The 
 lesser fauna and the avifauna should also be collected for refer- 
 ence and study — the field is very Avide. 

With proper arrangements and funds the Department could 
 also suppl}^ the Society Avith live specimens to fill its gaps. The 
 Department at present is so limited in personnel that it almost 
 entirely confines its energies to the game-keeping side, i. e., the 
 prevention of poaching, doubtless an important duty ; but more 
 stress requires to be laid on observation, and the collection of 
 accurate scientific data regarding the fauna. 

In the past, vacancies in the Game Department have been 
 filled in somevvdiat haphazard fashion from local applicants. TJiis 
 practice is, I believe, a mistake, and it is impossible to obtain 
 scientific data if it is continued. Here, again, this Society might 
 a,sk to be allowed to act as a selection board to see that only men 
 Avith the necessary zoological and biological qualifications Avere 
 •appointed to the Game Departments in tliis group of territories. 

It Avill, I think, be allowed that the Avhole question of the future 
 •of the game in East Central Africa is one of great interest,
