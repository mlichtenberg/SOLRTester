one another) and correct the extreme displacements of the septa, 
 we get the following (the seminal vesicle may be neglected, as being- 
 only a diverticulum of the posterior testis sac) (text-fig. 17).

The condition is similar to that in Desmogaster, except that the 
 spermathecse are a segment further back, and that there are three 
 pairs of prostates. If now we expand the testis sacs into segments, 
 we get a form with the following characters (text-fig. 18): —

The figure is identical, except for the characters already mentioned, 
 with that of the " expanded '"' Desmogaster. 

Pi-obably neither text-fig. 15 nor 18 represents a form that 
 actually existed. In the first place, there is a gap of a segment 
 between the two pairs of testes; and in the second place, the 
 apertures of the spermathecse are separated by only one segment, 
 while those of the male apparatus are separated by two segments, 
 and hence the spermathecal apertures would not coincide with 
 the male pores of another worm in copulation. 

It has been pointed out b}^ Michaelsen (12) that in all the lower 
 families of Oligochseta the gonads follow each other in successive 
 segments; the ovarian segment immediately follows the testicular 
 segment or segments ; and the normal arrangement in the higher 
 families (testes in segments x and xi, ovaries in xiii) is to be 
 explained by the dropping-out of a pair of ovaries in xii. The 
 original condition — two pairs of testes followed by two pairs of 
 ovaries — still exists in the genus Haplotaxis ; and hence Michael- 
 sen (12, 17) and Beddard (9) look on this genus as the ancestor 
 of the higher Oligochseta.
