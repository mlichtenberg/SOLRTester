CHARACTERS OF SOME HYSXRICOMORPH RODENTS. 391 

In Ccelogenys tlie fore foot is five-toed and artiodactyle. The 
 pollex is greatly reduced and represented externally merely by 
 its small nail, which is set some distance above the second digit. 
 The third and fourth digits are thick and subequal, and united 
 by webbing halfway between the plantar and digital pads. The 
 second is as thick as the third and considerably shorter ; but it 
 is stouter and longer than the fifth, and set a little more forwards. 
 The web between the second and third and fourth and fiftli is 
 less extensive than that between the third and fourth. These 
 four digits have powerful claws and well-developed smooth pads. 
 The carpal pad is lai'ge, three-lobed, and projects in the middle 
 in front, this portion having a truncated anterior margin. It is 
 roughened with papillae, if not all over, at least in the middle 
 line and laterally at the base of the second and fifth digits. 
 Separated from the plantar pad by a space of naked wrinkled skin 
 are the two well-developed nearly smooth carpal pads which are 
 in contact in the middle line. The whole of the inner side of 
 the wrist as far forward as the base of the second digit is covered 
 with very short hair as in Dasyprocta and Kerodon. (Text- 
 fig. 13, A.) 

The hind foot is also five-toed, but is perissodactyle. The first 
 and fifth digits are short and slender, the first being a little 
 smaller than the fifth ; and they arise nearly opposite one 
 another far up the sides of the foot, only a little in front of the 
 metatarsal j)ads and a long way behind the main mass of the 
 plantar pad. The second, third, and fourth digits are thick and 
 strong, the second and fourth being shorter than the third which 
 lies between them. There is a shallow web between them at the 
 base. The claws and digital pads are similar to those of the fore 
 foot. The main portion of the plantar pad is an irregularly 
 shaped cushion-like mass with two especially strongly papillate 
 areas corresponding to the interdigital spaces and attesting the 
 origin of this pad from two plantar interdigital elements. The 
 remaining two interdigital elements, seen in Octodon, for example, 
 have travelled away from the main portion of the pad, and are 
 represented by small pads at the base of the first and fifth digits, 
 although the one at the base of the first digit (pollex) is not 
 alwaj^s distinguishable. The metatarsal area is covered by a 
 large horny shield, distinctly double at its distal end, but only 
 indistinctly divided in two elsewhere. (Text-fig. 13, B.) 

The feet of Dasyprocta are in many respects very diflerent 
 from those of Ccelogenys, but seem to be derived from that type. 
 They are much thinner and longer. The foi'e foot is perisso- 
 dactyle ; the pollex is even more reduced than in Ccelogenys. The 
 fifth digit also is relatively smaller ; it is, moreover, set high up 
 the foot, almost on a level with the pollex, some distance behind 
 the plantar pad and slightly in advance of the carpal pad. The 
 second, third, and foiu-th digits are well developed, the second is 
 slightly shorter than the fourth, and both a,re shorter than the 
 third which lies between them. There is no visible basal webbing'.
