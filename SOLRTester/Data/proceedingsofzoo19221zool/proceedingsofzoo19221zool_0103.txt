a uniform outline. Below the sui-face are lai-ge spaces between 
 the main branches, and some of these are tenanted by Decapod 
 Ornstaceans about 1'5 cm. in length. The colony is slightly 
 disc-shaped, and has a very short, broad sterile stalk. 

2. Branching. From the uniform otitline and the arrange- 
 ment of the umbels in large hemispherical masses, it should 
 evidently be referred to Kiikentliars section TJmbellatfe, first 
 division, gi*oup disciforviis. 

3. Colouring. Generally of a pink and orange colour; the 
 supporting bundle red. 

4. Polyp stalks not over 1 mm. long. Text-fig. 22. 

5. Polyps in small bundles of 6-10. 

6. Polyp spicules. In the anthocodial 
 armature there are 4-5 pairs of con- 
 verging spindles en chevron in each of 
 the 8 points, and above these a much 
 larger converging spindle rising almost 
 0*5 miTj. beyond the polyp. In rare 
 cases two spindles share in the pro- 
 jection, which is very characteristic. 
 Below the points there is a vague crown, 
 and there are 2-4 small intermediates 
 between the points. All these spicules 
 are whitish. """ 

In the supporting bundle about three 
 very strong dark red densely spinose b. disciformis Kiik. 
 curved spindles project beyond the an- 

thocodiae, one being stronger than the others, and these are 
 based in sinalier but still strong spindles. The largest spindle 
 measures 4 mm. in length, and shows a distinctly smooth tip 
 (cf. D. gigantea). 

7. Other spicules. The upper cortex is densely covered with 
 long curved spindles, mostly in longitudinal arrangement, many 
 of them 2 mm. in length. Some ai-e i^ed, some yellowish, while 
 others are colourless. Only some of them show the distant fine 
 spines that Kiikenthal describes ; most are covered somewhat 
 densely. 

The lower cortex shows («) stout spindles with long conical 
 tubercles : (6) very numerous small irregular stars with longish 
 prongs, which may again be divided and are suited for inter- 
 locking ; (c) large triradiates and quadriradiates covered with 
 strong tubercles, sometimes massive and compound. A typical 
 triraciiate is about 1 mm. in maximum length, which is much 
 larger than Kiikenthal notes. But, of course, they occur in 
 many sizes. 

Salient features. — We should say that this species is best 
 marked by (1) the strongly projecting 8 spindles at the tops of 
 the points, (2) the strong red supporting bundle with its longest 
 spindle smooth at the tip, and (3) the compact disc-like mode of 
 o-rowth in the full-grown colonies. It should also be noted that
