Description of Angolan Springbuck. 

AnTIBOKCAS ANGOLEXSIS, Sp. 11. 

Lai'ger than euchore, Avith longer, narrower head and axis 
 of horns in line with frontal plane. In males, horns not so stout 
 ■at base and, viewed laterally, less sinuous than in euchore. 
 In females, horns long, perfectly developed and annulated, lyrate 
 in form, with tips hooked inwards and backwards, and in all 
 respects exact models of the male hoiiis. Ears very large : of a 
 male 165 mm., female 184 mm. 

Colour as in euchore, but stronger and bi'ighter throughout; 
 the triangular frontal patch always present and edged below with 
 bright mahogany-brown. 

Skull relatively longer, nari'ower, and vertically less deep than 
 in euchore, with straight frontal profile and shallower lacrymal 
 pits. Horn-pedicles in line with frontal plane, so that a line 
 drawn vertically through centre of orbits falls outside and in 
 front of their axis. Basally palate not convex, basioccipital having 
 equal or greater length than breadth. 

Hah. The coastal region of Angola from Benguela southwards 
 towards Damaraland.

The Angolan Springbucks herein described were obtained from 
 the coastal belt between Benguela and Mossamedes. The Copo- 
 roUo River appears to be the approximate northern limit of their 
 range, though a few stragglers have been seen, in some j^ears, 
 aci-oss the Benguela Railway. They roam in herds over the 
 sandy flats, though never, I believe, in great concourses, grazing 
 on the soft featliery grass that grows on the open flats, and nibbling 
 the foliage of the thorn-bushes that line the courses of the sand- 
 rivers, and are scattered on the stony approaches to the hills. 
 They are also fond of frequenting the quai'tz- strewn wastes, 
 where their bright, clear appearance and elegant outline is in 
 lovely harmony with the glistening white stone and pale green 
 vegetation. 

T'he habits of Springbuck haA^e been so often and so Avell 
 ■described by naturalists and hunters, that it is unnecessary to 
 add my observations to theirs. I am able, hoAvever, to record 
 one fresh scrap of information Avhich I believe to have escaped 
 notice. In Angola the fawns are dropped in January. During 
 the early pnrt of that month, in 1919,1 saAv many Springbuck, 
 the does being then heavy Avith young, but I did not see any faAvns 
 about. On the 12th of January, I vi^ent down to the coast, 
 returning to my camp inland three Aveeks later. During that 
 interA^al the does had dropped their faAvns, and they were to be 
 found lying about on stony ground in the open or under thorn- 
 bushes, Avhere their mothers had left them during the day. 
 I once very nearly trod on one of these little creatures, huddled 
 betAveen some pieces of quartzite, for they lay verv close until
