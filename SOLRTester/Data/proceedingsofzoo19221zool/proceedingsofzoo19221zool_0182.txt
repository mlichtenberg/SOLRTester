their funnels, and the alimentary canal is excluded. The testis 
 sacs have similar relations ; and if the ovarian chamber were to 
 lose its nephridia, and to become divided into two, one for the 
 organs of each side, we should have an identical condition 
 reproduced. It is difficvilt to resist the conclusion that the testis 
 sacs owe their origin to the same process which we can see and 
 follow in the case of the ovarian segment. 

Beddard, so long ago as 1891 (6), suggested this origin for the 
 testis sacs ; he thinks they " may be all that is left of the ccelom 
 belonging to the segment which contains the testes." He adds : 
 " This is of course no more than a suggestion"; and, so far as I 
 know, the suggestion has never since been considered. But 
 I believe that the above considerations show with some degree of 
 probability that this is really the true nature of the sacs. 

(3) The Relationships of the Genera of Moniligastridce. 

In the present section I omit the consideration of the recently 
 discovered genus Syngenodr'dus, to which reference will be made 
 later, and confine myself to the previously known genera of 
 the family. 

The most primitive of the four genera is Desmogaster, in which 
 the sexual organs are arranged as shown in the accompanying 
 figure (text-fig. 11). I use letters to indicate the several segments, 
 since it is easier thus to make comparisons between this and 
 other genera.

There may be either one or two pairs of spermathecse ; two 
 pairs are shown in the figui^e, but if only one pair is present it 
 may be either the anterior or the posterior. 

Eupolygastei- is derived from Desmogaster by the disappearance 
 of the posterior set of male organs and the anterior sperma- 
 thecse (the anterior spermathecse are the complement of the 
 posterior male organs ; these face each other when the worms
