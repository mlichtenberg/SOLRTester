SPIDERS FROM SOUTH ANNAM. 289 

front laterals, on a joint tubercle. The front median eyes are 
 distinctly smaller than the others, their diameter distant from 
 the rear median, slightly more from one another, and ]^ diameter 
 from their side eyes. 

The surface of the cephalothorax is smooth, with the exception 
 of very fine bristles on roots scattered at intervals on the cephalic 
 pai't. 

The clypeus is convex, pei'pendiculai-, twice as deep as the 
 length of the median eye square. 

The mandibles are straight along the outer edges, divergent on 
 the inner; on the inner margin of the falx-sheath at the far 
 corner is a triangular tooth, on the outer margin two smaller 
 near the middle. The fangs are long and slender. 

The lip is about 2| times as broad as long, curved in front, 
 straight at the sides, and immovable. The maxillfe are nearly 
 three times as high as the lip, over which they bend, nearly 
 meeting one another, with straight edges on the upper part of 
 the inside, truncate anteriorly, and with a hollow about the 
 middle of the outer side. 

The sternum is a long shield-shape, curved in front round the 
 bases of the lip and maxillas, and passing in a narrow point 
 between the rear coxa?. 

The abdomen is oval, smooth, slightly protruding over the 
 cephalothorax. On the upper side it is sparsely furnished with 
 rather long, fine bristles, on the under side similar but shorter. 
 The epigyne consists of a lunate flat shelf protruding from a 
 kidney-shaped convex area, which fills the median part of the 
 former. The spinnerets are not quite tei'minal, on chitinous 
 bases, conical, with a short 2nd joint. 

The legs are moderately long and fine, wuthout spines, the 
 metatarsal joints longer than the tibial. The two upper tarsal 
 claws are bent at the anterior end, with about five pectinations 
 on the basal half. The third claw smooth. The palpal claw is 
 straighter, with about five pectinations, also.
