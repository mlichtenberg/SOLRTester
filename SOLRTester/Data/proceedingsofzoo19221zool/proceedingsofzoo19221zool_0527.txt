trunk which divides into middle subscapular and circumflex. The 
 musculo-spiral nerve is formed by the posterior division of the 
 conjoined fifth and sixth, the posterior division of the seventh, 
 and the posterior division of the conjoined eighth cervical and first 
 dorsal nerves as in Homo. 

The posterior division of the seventh and the whole of the 
 eighth cervical nerves fuse to form a trunk which divides into 
 median and ulnar nerves. The median has externally only a 
 single head of origin, so it dit.ers from those of Macacus rhesus 
 and Homo, in which two were seen.

The lumbo-sacral plexus. S.G. and I.G : superior and inferior gluteal nerves ;

The long subscapular werfe arises from the back of the musculo- 
 spiral nerve as in some examples of Macacus rhesus (1). And 
 Brooks points out that, although its origin may vary considerably, 
 it is always related in some way to the musculo-spiral. 

The nerves to the pectoral muscles arise from the median nerve, 
 but they may simply run through the latter for a considerable 
 distance. 

In my opinion the musculo- cutaneous nerve represents the 
 outer cord in the human plexus, the posterior cord is represented 
 by the separated circumflex and musculo-spiral nerves, and the 
 inner cord is the band which divides into median and ulnar 
 nerves. It is, however, diflScult to explain how the median and
