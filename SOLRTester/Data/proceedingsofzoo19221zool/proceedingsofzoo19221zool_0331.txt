PARASITES OF ELEPHANTS. 275 

Genus Bathmostomum Rail], & Henry, 1909. 

Small neniatodes having the head curved towards the dorsum, 
 the oral aperture facing anteriorly nnd dorsally. The oral 
 capsule is fissured on its dorsal and lateral aspects. Its internal 
 surface is raised mainly ventrally and laterally into shelf-like 
 projections encroaching on the oral cavity, A small dorsal tooth 
 surmounts the dorsal column of the oesophagus, which is simple 
 and cup-shaped. 

Male : The dorsal I'ays are separate for nearly their whole 
 extent, the externo-dorsal rays springing from the individual 
 dorsal lays. The lateral rays turn ventrally. The spicules are 
 stout. There is no accessory piece. 

Female: The vulva lies near the middle of the body. The 
 uteri are divergent, furnished with strong ovejectors. 

Type-species, Bathinostomum sangeri. 

Bathmostomum sangeri Oobbold, 1879. 

Dochmius sangeri Cobbold, 1879. 

Uncinaria sangeri Railliet, 1896 (not Alessandrini, 1905). 
 Uncinaria os-pa^nllatum Plana & Stazzi, 1900. 
 Bathmostomum sangeri Raill. & Henry, 1909. 

The oral cavity is wider than long. There are two sub-ventral 
 teeth. The male is 15-16 mm. long and the female is 20 mm. 
 long. The spicules 0'47mm. in length. Yulva lies near the 
 middle of the body. 

Habitat. Csecum of Indian elephant (India). 

Genus BuNOSTOMUM Raill., 1902. 

Capsuled bursate nematodes having the mouth guarded by 
 ventral semilunes. The dorsal and externo-dorsal rays aie asym- 
 metrical. The mouth cavity contains a dorsal tooth, being the 
 freely projecting ducts of the dorsal oesophageal gland. There is 
 a pair of sub-ventral lancets at its base. 

BuNOSTOMUM foliatum Cobbold, 1882. 

Strongylus foliatus Cobbold, 1882. 

Uncinaria sangeri Alessandrini, 1 905 (not Railliet, 1896). 

Bi(,noston mm foliatum Raill., Henr}' & Bauche, 1914. 

This nematode was imperfectly described by Cobbold in 1879, 
 and has never been recorded since. Its inclusion in the genus 
 Bunostomum, is regarded by Railliet as a provisional mattei-. 
 Probably it will prove to be a representative of a new genus.
