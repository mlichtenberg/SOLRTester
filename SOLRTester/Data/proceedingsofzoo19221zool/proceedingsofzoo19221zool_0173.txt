well-marked connective-tissue (blue-staining) coat, 2-5 ^i thick 
 and rather loose in texture. 

Having reached the parietes it runs backwards for a short 
 distance, and then, sinking into the body-wall, lies in the blue- 
 staining connective tissue between the two muscular layers ; 
 here its diameter is 30 /i, and its connective-tissue coat is still 
 moderately thick. Arrived at the base of the prostate, it enters 
 this organ at its lower end, and runs upward outside the 
 muscular coat of the prostate and within the layer of large cells, 
 in a direction parallel to the prostatic lumen ; its diameter is 
 now 20 ju, and it still possesses a deeply staining connective- 
 tissue layer outside its epithelium. Sinking through the 
 muscular layer of the prostate, the rest of its course lies within 
 that coat, in the lining epithelium (fig. 3, v. clef.) ; it finally opens 
 into the prostatic lumen at the ental extremity of the latter. 
 In this 'last part of its course it loses its blue-staining layer and 
 becomes a small, round tube of cubical cells, 18 /i in diameter. 

The actual i-elations of vas and prostate are thus disguised, 
 inasmuch- as the vas, entering the prostate at the base of the 
 latter, and ascending within its wall to the apex, is hidden from 
 view dui'ing this part of its course. In a species of Dravnda 
 {D. razri) which I have recently described (28), and which is in 
 respect of its male apparatus the most primitive of the genus (it 
 possesses two pairs of prostates, an ancestral chara.ctei-), " the vas 
 deferens, joining the prostate below, can be seen running up its 
 surface towards the free upper end." In Moniligaster deshayesi 
 the prostates are very large and sausage-shaped, and extend back 
 through several segments ; ■ the vas deferens passes back along it 
 to fuse with it some little distance from its ental end ; and 
 presumably sections would show that here, too, the vas is a 
 separate tube as far as the ental end of the prostate, where the 
 one presumabl)^ passes into the other ; in two varieties of this 
 species the vas can be seen in an ordinary dissection to enter the 
 ental end of the prostate. 

In certain species of the genus Dravnda, therefore, and more 
 obviously in the genus Moniligaster, the prostate is to be regarded 
 as the thickened continuation of the vas defei^ens surrounded' by 
 a bulky mass of peritoneal cells. These cells give the organ th6 
 soft and papillose surface which frequently characterizes it. In 
 other species of Drmoida, however, the surface of the prostates 
 is firm and shining — an appearance which is associated with a 
 firm muscular investment ; either there is here no soft covering 
 of swollen peritoneal cells, or the layer is so intermixed with and 
 covered by muscular fibres as to give a firm and resistant 
 surface.
