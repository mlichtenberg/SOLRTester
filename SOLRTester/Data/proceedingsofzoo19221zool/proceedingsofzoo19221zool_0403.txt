light ground are reversed. Colour of stripes rusty liver-brown, 
 darkening to sepia ou neck and down legs to hoofs, where it forms 
 a broad coronary band. On the top of the back, and notably in 
 the lumbar region, the stripes are speckled with ochraceous hairs. 
 Gridiron pattern fades into indistinct lines and spots as it 
 approaches the tail ; also down its basal third. Central dorsal 
 stripe very narrow. Stripes down flanks taper to a point in line 
 with elbow, leaving the chest, belly, and inside of thighs white. 
 A broad band of sepia runs down centre of belly to chest. 
 Ground-colour above a warm tone of ochraceous or sandy buff, 
 paling below to bufiy white. Centre of tail ochraceous buflf, 
 fading to white at sides. Tail tuft ragged and thin, bufFy white

 Head. â€” Stripes on forehead liver-brown, close and narrow with 
 blurred edges, paling to warm sienna down face and on cheeks. 
 Muzzle sienna,. Ears as in zebra but more lightly marked, with 
 bi'own tips. Mane striped dark brown and white, the dark 
 stripes fading to bistre at the ends of the hairs, which are long 
 and ragged, the longest measuring 7 inches. 

The skin has a faded rusty appeai'ance throughout. Chest- 
 nuts on forelegs large, smooth, and oval, measuring 4| inches by 
 3J inches. Hoof measuring 4^ inches by 2^ inches, both fore 
 and hind being very similar. They aie very hard. The frog 
 shows only an outline, being worn quite smooth. The heels are 
 long. 

This Zebra is a massively built animal, considerably larger than 
 the Bonte Quagga and approximating to a Grevy Zebra in size. 
 The head is long and heavy, with a large muzzle. That of one 
 old stallion I shot resembled a cart-horse, with deep pits abo\ e the 
 eyes, Roman nose, and pendulous lower lip. The ears are large. 
 There is in both sexes a dewlap 3 inches deep and commencing 
 at about the same distance from the throttle. The loose skin 
 of tlie dewlap is much thickened towards its apex, the whole 
 of the skin of the neck increasing in thickness from above down- 
 wards. The end of the dewlap contains an indurated ball of 
 flesh, about the size of a large walnut, lodged in fatty ti!^sue which 
 is adhesive to the skin. The neck is short and deep, the withers 
 low. and the back level and rather long. The limbs are massive, 
 with big bony knees and hocks and big cannon-bones. 

Inaction this Zebra moves more f reel}'' than the Bonte Quagga, 
 whose paces are short and lumbering. When suddenly startled, 
 he gallops off with head carried high and nearly horizontal and 
 neck arched backwards, but soon settles down to a slinging trot. 
 At this pace the knees and hocks are well flexed. A herd in 
 retreat always makes for the hills, up which thej^ clamber with 
 marvellous ease and surety over the roughest, stoniest ground. 

The hills of this country are traced all over by their paths, so 
 worn as to resemble native foot-tracks. It is only possible to get 
 over some parts of the country by using the Zebra paths, and 
 the main footpath along the coast between Dombe Grande and
