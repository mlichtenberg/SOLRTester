functions. The tabular is a mucli more important element. 
 Besides being a bone of the top of the skull, it is also an occipital 
 element with important bony and muscular attachments. The 
 supratempoi-al is apparently very rarely, if ever, an occipital 
 element at all. For these and other i-easons which I am else- 
 where giving, I regard the upper element in all the later reptiles 
 in which it occurs as the tabular. 

In Mixosaurus, Gymhosponclylus, and Ichthyosaurus the back 
 of the temporal fossa and much of the occipital margin is formed 
 by the tabular. The squamosal is situated below it. The 
 relations of the two bones are strikingly similar to those in 
 lizards. 

For the discussion of the temporal region in the two-arched 
 reptiles we are very fortunate in having two good skulls of an 
 animal that must be pretty near to the ancestral type. Younyina 
 capensis, which I described a few years ago, is too specialised in 
 having a long snout to have itself been the Diapsid ancestor, 
 but it is sufficiently near for all morphological purposes. The 
 temporal region is remarkably interesting. The squamosal is 
 large and lies almost entirely behind the infratemporal fossa. 
 Above the squamosal lies a bone which I think there can be 
 little doubt is the tabular. It is situated between the parietal 
 and the squamosal. The relations of the bones will be best 
 understood from the figure given. Whatever doubt there might 
 have been about the identification of the squamosal in the type- 
 skull is removed by the second skull which I was fortunate in 
 discovering. This second skull, though it lacks the occiput, has 
 the snout well pi-eserved. 

The Thalattosauria form a group of very remarkable marine 
 reptiles, which seem to have some affinity with the lizards and 
 Sphenodon. Unfortunately, they are very imperfectly known. 
 Merriam, who first described them, gave good figures of the 
 specimens and attempted restorations of the skull. Huene, who 
 has since examined the material, diflfers from Merriam in the 
 interpretation of some of the parts of the temporal region. The 
 most important difference of opinion is that Huene considers 
 that the squamosal of Merriam is really the supratemporal, and 
 finds the true squamosal in a much smaller bone situated below 
 the larger bone. I am inclined to think that in this Huene is 
 probably right. I give a restoration of the skull, modified from 
 Merriiim in the light of Huene's later observations, and with 
 the occiput restored as I think it may have been. If this 
 figui-e be compared with that of Younyina (text-fig. 4, A &, B), it 
 will be seen that Thalattosaurus is strikingly similar in type, 
 but specialised in a manner curiously parallel to that seen in 
 the primitive Ichthyosamvs Cymbospondylus and Mixosaurus. 

The Lacei-tilia have given rise to much difference of opinion, 
 not only as to which of the two post-temporal bones is the 
 squamosal, but also as to whether they are really descended from 
 ancestors with two temporal fossee. It has long seemed to me
