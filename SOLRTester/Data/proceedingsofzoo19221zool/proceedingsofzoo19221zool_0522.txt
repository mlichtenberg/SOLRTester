vagus gives oil' two tliinmn- l^iaiicbcs whicli l)i'enk up into several 
 twigs to a deep cardiac plexus. 

6. Pulmonary Nerves (text-tigs. 20 & 21, f/ and y') : — The left 
 vagus gives off two anterior pulmonary nerves before it passes to 
 the dorsal surface of the root of the left lung {g'). On the dorsal 
 surface of the pulmonary root it gives off three posterior 
 pulmonary nerves [g). The right vagus gives off one anterior 
 pulmonary nerve under cover of the vena azygos major, where it 
 curls over the root of the right lung to join the superior vena 
 cava. Behind the pulmonary root it divides into two branches. 
 One of tliese (h) is distriljuted to the posterior pulmonary plexus, 
 and then rejoins the other division. 

7. (Esojyhageal nerves (text-fig. 21, O.N) : — The left vagus gives 
 oft' several oesophageal branches which form a plexus guhie. The 
 right vagus gives an ascending oesophageal nerve (O.N'j, and some 
 small bivanches which anastomose with those of the left nerve. 

The left vagus runs through theventi-al part of the oesophageal 
 opening in the diaphragm, and the right vagus runs tlirough the 
 dorsal part. A complicated series of anastomoses between their 
 branches takes place in the posterior part of the thorax (text- 
 lig. 20). 

"The left vagus gives many branches to the esophagus and 
 ventral surface of the stomach, and twigs can be traced into the 
 splenic and superior mesenteric plexuses. Communications can 
 also be traced to the left splanchnic nerves (text-fig. 22). 

The right vagus supplies the doi'sal surface of the stomach, and 
 bi-anches run to the solar plexus (text-fig. 21). 

No direct communications run between tlie vagus and phrenic 
 nerves. 

The Spinal Accessory Nerve (text-fig. 19, xi) has the usual 
 relations to other nerves at its emergence from the foramen 
 lacerum posticum. It lies on the dorsal aspect of the sterno- 
 mastoid and cleido-mastoid, and it gains the deep sui'face of the 
 trapezius. It passes postero-laterally and runs over the dorsum 
 of the scapula between the ventral border and root of the spine. 
 It can be traced into the most posterior fibres of the trapezius. 

It forms a rich plexus vi'ith the cervical nerves, and com- 
 munications run between it and the ninth, tenth, and twelfth 
 nerves. 

The Hypoglossal iVeri'e (text-fig. 19,xii) communicates with the 
 other nerves at the base of the skull and describes a wide loop. 
 Reaching the tongue by passing on the surface of hyoglossus it 
 divides into two branches. One is more superficial, and gives off 
 numerous fine muscular twigs. The other is deeper and thicker, 
 and can be traced almost to the tip of the tongue. Before it 
 divides, the hypoglossal gives off the descendens (D.H) nerve and 
 communicates with the lingual nerve. The former enters as 
 usual into the ansa hypoglossi. 

In text-fig. 19 the three distinct nerve supplies to the tongue 
 are shown.
