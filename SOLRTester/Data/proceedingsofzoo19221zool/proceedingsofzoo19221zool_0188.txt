the accessory spermatliecal glands in Draioida schunkarai

 glands in the geuei-a Hoplochceiella and Erythrceodrilus, belonging 
 to another family, the Megascolecidje. 

(6) The Origin of the Moniligastridce. 

If the testis sacs represent segments, they must have existed 
 as such in the ancestors of the present genera. Let us take 
 Desmogaster, as the most archaic of existing genera of Monili- 
 gastridpe, and expand the testis sacs into segments ; "we get a 
 form which may be represented as in the accompanying figure 
 (text- fig. 15).

Now let US take the remai-kable genus Syngenodrilus, described 
 by Smith and Green (20), and separated by them as a distinct 
 subfamily. The actual arrangement of the sacs and septa is 
 approximately represented in the subjoined figure (text-fig. 16), 
 which is a diagrammatic copy of the section illustrated in the 
 original paper.

Note the three pairs of prostate gia.nds, which, however, are none 
 of them in close association with the male dvicts or pores ; it is 
 quite possible, therefore, that these prostates of Syngenodrilus 
 have nothing to do with the structures that go under the same 
 name in the other genera of the family. If we expand this 
 fioure, so as to sepai'ate the testis sacs (which are close up against
