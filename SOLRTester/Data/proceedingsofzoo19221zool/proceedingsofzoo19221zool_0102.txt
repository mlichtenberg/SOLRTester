uiBbellate groups. The upper part of the stalk, however, as 
 Kiikenthal describes, shows an incrustation of minute polyps. 

6. Polyi) spicules. The anthocodial 

armature conforms with Kiikenthal's Text-fig. 21. 

figure, but I should describe it some- /"-^ 

what difierently, for it seems to me to 
 have in each true point only one pair, 
 one member of which is distinctly larger 
 than the other, all the other (4-6) spi- 
 cules being referable to the crown. 
 Kukenthardescribes two closely opposed 
 spicules forming the upper part of the 
 point, below 1-2 pairs of horizontals and 
 below that again 3-4 converging pairs. 
 On my view, however, each point con- 
 sists of a pair of spicules. 

The supporting bundle is very short, b. longicaulis Kiik. 

scarcely projecting. 

7. Other spicules. The coi^tex of the branches is closely covered 
 with strong spindles of typical shape and blunt tubercles — 
 a feature in which this specimen does not conform to Kiikenthal's 
 description of D. longicaulis, where " the branch-cortex contains 
 separate longitudinally disposed very narrow spindles with sharp 
 thorns up to 2 mm. in length." 

On the other hand, the cortex of the stalk shows a close array 
 of stars as Kiikenthal describes, and with the same average 
 diameter of O'l mm. Among the stars are a few broad, short, 
 densely tuberculatex spin dies.

Described by Kiikenthal in ' Versuch einer Revision der 
 Alcyonarien,' ii. pp. 636-638 (1905). 

Diagnosis : — Umbellate; compact; disc-like ; outline uniform ; 
 polyps in bundles of 6-10 ; polyp stalks medium : supporting 
 bundle very strong ; point spicules about 5 pairs, with the upper- 
 most larger spicule predominating and projecting ; no croAvn ; 
 grade lY. ; spicules : in the upper cortex long, curved spindles 
 (2 mm.), in the lower cortex stout spindles, irregular stellate 
 bodies for interlocking, and large triradiates and quadriradiates ; 
 colour : generally pink and orange, supporting bundles red . 

Anthocodial Grade and Formula : — 

lY. = I + 4 p + Or -I- very strong S.B.

1. Colony as a tohole. Six specimens. Each a compact colony 
 of a generally uniform outline, with its umbels arranged in larger 
 hemispherical masses which are superficially in contact, forming
