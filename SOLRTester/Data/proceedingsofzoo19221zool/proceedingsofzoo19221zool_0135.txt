OF THE WATER-BEETLE PELOBIUS TARDUS, 91 

food material. An examiuation of tlie .stomodteiini, however, 
 explained the mystery. 

The mouth-parts consist of a pair of sharply-pointed mandibles 
 which overlap when closed, the right ovei'lying the left. The 
 maxillte are palp-like in appearance, the maxilla itself forming 
 the basal part of the palp, and, when at rest, the whole structure 
 is contracted by being telescoped within the base (v. PI. II. 
 figs. 1 to 4). The labium has an ajjical piece, which, from its 
 appearance, I will call the "scoop " (s), and which, when at rest, 
 is contracted within the basal piece which bears the two short 
 labial palpi (v. PI. II. figs. 1 to 4). 

When the floor of the mouth is examined (v. PI. II. fig. 1), 
 it will be seen that at the base of the extensible part of the labium 
 is a small, projecting piece in the median line. This piece, which 
 I will call the " flap " (/), rises up in the " scoop," and when the 
 mouth is closed this flap stands up, and the lobes of the epi- 
 pharynx — this structure being split like a hair-lip — descend 
 from above and thus block the entrance. The anterior part 
 of the floor of the mouth is covered with minute projections 
 arranged more or less in rows radiating from a deep groove, 
 while the anterior part of the scoop is similarly studded. In the 
 posterior region of the floor of the mouth is a dark brown 
 chitinous plate (Ay/>) with a raised median piece posterior to it, 
 and I regard these structures as representing the hypopharynx. 
 On either side of the chitinous plate there projects inwards a 
 membranous lobe (mxl) which is extremely difficult to make 
 out ; I examined a large number of specimens before I could 
 satisfy myself that it really existed. Possibly these lobes 
 represent the maxilluljB. 

Immediately I^ehind the hypopharynx the mouth contracts into 
 the gullet, which is very short and opens out at once into the 
 cesophagus (v. PI. I. fig. 6). This again is very short, and there 
 is no pro-ventriculus clearly marked off at its posterior end, but 
 this region is armed with eight dark- coloured spines (v. PL II. 
 figs. 5 & 6), which project forward in the walls and posteriorly 
 are enlarged. The inner faces of these spines are armed with 
 strong, backwardly turned teeth which are specially numerous on 
 the enlarged bases, and evidently form the grinding-mill by menus 
 of which the food is broken up. 

With the exception of a pair on each side whose bases are 
 fused together, each spine is independent of the others. The 
 median ventral one is the longest, and extends forwards for about 
 two-thirds the length of the oesophagus, none of the other spines 
 extending more than half the length of the cjesophagus. 

To the o3sophageal walls, between the pro-ventricular spines, 
 are attached muscles which run to the head capsule, so that the 
 oesophagus is capable of considerable expansion and contraction. 
 In this case, therefore, almost the whole stomodjBum acts as a 
 sucking-pump, there being no pharynx marked ofi'for this purpose, 
 as is usually the case.
