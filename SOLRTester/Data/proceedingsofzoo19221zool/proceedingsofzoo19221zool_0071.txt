Paet I. — General. 

§ 1. All who have worked at Alcjonarians will agree as to the 
 ditiiculties presented by the genus Dendroneplithya or Spongodes. 
 For here we have to deal with a multitude of species within 
 a relatively narrow range. Thus Kiikenthal, in his ' Versuch 
 einer Revision der Alcyonarien : II. Die Familie der Neph- 
 thyiden, 2. Teil ' 1905, deals with no fewer than eighty-seven 
 species ; and Henderson, in the ' Alcyonarians of the Indian 
 Ocean,' Part II. 1909, with another series of sixty different from 
 the former. And yet in both cases the species are described in 
 minute detail. 

The continual experience in investigating a collection of repre- 
 sentatives of this genus is that, in spite of an initial determi- 
 nation to refrain from adding to the already large number of 
 described species, one is forced to do so. And there is no 
 denying that each of these new forms has a distinct individuality. 
 This experience inevitably raises a number of setiological questions 
 which it may be useful to state,. although they cannot be more 
 than partially answered. Some of them at least could be replied 
 to by an investigator in a good locality, having at his command 
 a large number of specimens of any given form. 

§ 2. The outstanding phenomena which present themselves are, 
 apart from the multitudinous species, the following : — 

A. That the specific distinctions are all of a relatively trivial 
 sort, such as mode of branching, grouping of polyps, length of 
 polyp stalk, strength of supporting bundle, jDresence or absence 
 of a definite " crown," the number and the arrangement of the 
 spicules in the anthocodial points, the distinction between the 
 cortex of the polyparium and that of the "sterile stalk," and the 
 nature of the spiculation of the canal-walls. 

B. That the species difier one from the other to a large extent 
 in the congeries or collocation of such characters as we have 
 mentioned ; that is to say, two species with similar anthocodial 
 armature may dLfter in the mode of branching, and vice versa. 

C. That within the limits of a colony there is, in most cases,
