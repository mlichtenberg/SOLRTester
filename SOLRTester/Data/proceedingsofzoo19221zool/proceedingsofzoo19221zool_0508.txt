the precetliiig part. It woi'ks over a strong cord running from 
 the first rib to the head of the humerus (text-fig. IOC, C.C.L). 
 And this ligament may replace the costo-coracoid ligament in 
 Man. The iir.st and third p irts receive separate nerves from the 
 median nerve, but tlie latter probably only serves as a track from 
 the brachial plexus (text-fig. 23). 

The pectoralis minor may be replaced by the third part of 
 pectoralis major. 

A lonof, narrow muscle, composed of two bellies, takes origin 
 fi'om the free edge of the latissimus dorsi, crosses the axillary 
 vessels and brachial nerves, and spreads out into a thin fan- 
 sliaped aponeurosis. The latter covers the coraco-brachialis and 
 bicep-, and is inserted into the deep surface of the insertion of 
 pectoralis major. It has a double nerve supply from the second 
 intercostal nerve and brachial plexus (text-fig. 11, G). 

The subclavins (taxt-^g. IOC) is very strong. It arises from 
 the inner end of the first rib by a strong pointed tendon, and is 
 inserted into the inner five-sixths of the posterior surface of the 
 clavicle. 

The clelto-jjectoral triangle (text-fig. 10 A, D.P.T) is long and 
 narrow. It contains the cephalic vein and thoracic axis artery-, 
 but no lymphatic glands. 

The skin over the pectoral region is supplied, as in Man, by 
 the supraclavicular nerves from the cervical plexus. 

The trapezius arises from the inner part of the occipital crest, 
 the inion, ligamentum nuchte, seventh cervical and upper six 
 dorsal spines, and supraspinal ligaments. And the thick, strong 
 fibres converge, a.s in Man. They are inserted as in Man, but the 
 fibres which are attached to the root of the spine of the scapula 
 end in a very strong triangular tendon, under which the spinal 
 accessory nerve passes to the posterior part of the muscle. The 
 sub-trapezial nerve plexus formed by the spinal accessory and 
 cervical nerves is well-de%'eloped. 

Latissimus dorsi: â€” Xo fibres are derived from ribs and the 
 posterior angle of the scapula, and the upper fibres of origin are 
 under cover of the trapezius. They extend from the fourth Lo 
 the last dorsal vertebra, behind which they arise from the lumbar 
 aponeurosis, but no fibres extend back to the ilium. The fibres 
 converge, wind roun<l the lower border of the teres major, and end 
 in a very strong, flat tendon which is inserted into the humerus 
 at the base of the pectoral crest (text-figs. 10, L.D and 11, H). 
 The tendon is intimately connected to the teres major and dorso- 
 epitrochlearis. 

The levator angidi scapuke ai-ises from the dorsal surfaces of 
 the transverse processes of the first four cervical vertebi-je, and 
 the slip from the first one is the largest. The fibres unite to 
 form a thick muscle, which is inserted into the vertebral border 
 and deep surface of the scapula in its anterior part. 

The rhomboids form a strong muscular sheet arising from the 
 vertebral spines from the seventh cervical to the fifth dorsal ;
