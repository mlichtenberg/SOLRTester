Bursa. — The bursa has a wrinkled appearance. Its edges are 
 curled inside. Tiie dorsal is indistinctly separated from the 
 lateral lobes. It is not elongated as in A. piletda. The general 
 arrangement of the rays, however, is common to both species. 
 The bursa is '67 mm. long and •54 mm. broad. 

The pre-bursal papilla is thin and wavy, and is '3 mm. in length. 
 It is easily mistaken for a ray. 

The ventral ray is bifid in its terminal half. The two branches 
 lie close together. 

The lateral rays lie close together, and their terminations are 
 bent inwards exactly in the same manner as in A. inhata. 

The extei-no-dorsal ray is long and ends very near the edge of 
 the bursa.

The dorsal ray is massive. It divides at the level of the origin 
 of the externo-dorsal ray. Each of these primary divisions gives 
 a thick, short lateral branch, Avhich almost immediately divides 
 into two. These are very short and do not reach the edge of the 
 bursa. The main stem is longer and ends near the corresponding 
 ray of the other side. 

The length of the dorsal ray is "25 mm. 

Genital cone. — The genital cone is sharply pointed. It is, 
 however, a more massive structure than that of A. inleata. The 
 apex of the cone lies nearly in a line with the ventral sui-face of 
 the body. It is not marked with any cuticular thickenings. 

Genital opening. — The cloacal opening is placed practically at 
 the apex of the genital cone.
