 the base as well as the bunch at the distal end.

These specimens certainly appertain to the above genus, andf 
 are very close to M. Lucas's 31. (Attus) melanognathus, a very 
 widely-spread species which I have not seen; but judging from 
 the list of allied species given by Dr. Thorell (' Ragni Indo- 
 Malesi,' p. 307), it would seem to differ only in the pattern of 
 the abdomen, generally lighter colouring, and longer legs.
