82 MR. F. BALFOUR-BROWNE ON THE LIFE-HISTORY 

although in some of these, e. g. "Wexford, there were many ideal 
 ponds, and although I was specially looking for this species, I 
 never found a specimen. I therefore regard the Irish individuals 
 as having strayed from the English breeding centres, the species 
 so far having failed to establish itself west of the Irish Sea. 

(3) The Imago, (a) Habitat and Habits. 

Pelobius is a pond species, never-, in my experience, occurring 
 in drains, lakes, or running water, but it seems to be very par- 
 ticular as to the type of pond it frequents. It is apparently only 
 found in ponds where the bottom is covered with a fine " ooze," 
 so that gravel- or marl-pits are ideal habitats. In some cases the 
 water of such ponds is clear and bright, while in others the pond 
 is a favourite haunt of cattle during hot weather, the water then 
 becoming thick and turbid and containing a high percentage of 
 ammonia. The (rattle pond is quite as thickly populated as the 
 clean pond, so that it is the "ooze" which seems to be the im- 
 portant characteristic of the habitat. 

In this "ooze" the beetle frequently buries itself, so that only 
 the apex of the body, often with a protruding air-bubble, is 
 visible, and, during the summer, it may remain thus buried for 
 even more than thirty minutes at a time, coming up rapidly to 
 the surface to renew its air-supply, which takes from five to ten 
 seconds, and then once more disappearing in the mud. 

By keeping the beetles in tumblers of water half filled with 
 pond mud, I have found that at irregular intervals the air-bubble 
 protruding from the apex of the body is released, and another 
 then appears in its place and gradually increases in size. At first 
 I was satisfied to explain this on the supposition that these were 
 bubbles of exhausted air, but I can find no statement as to the 
 mechanism of respiration in the Water- Beetle, or as to how the 
 sub-elytral air is utilized ; and I am not now inclined to speculate 
 on the subject beyond saying that possibly the released bubbles 
 are merely due to the expansion of the air in the sub-elytral air- 
 space, due either to the body temperature of the insect or to the 
 tem.perature or pressure of the mud. 

The food of the imago consists of insect larvae and worms, and 
 while I was working at the life-history I kept my specimens in 
 tumblers, feeding them mainly upon chopped-up earthworm, which 
 they took readily. Agrionid dragonfly nymphs, Chironomus 
 larvae, Sialis larvae, and various other forms, were readily 
 devoured, but more active types, such as Chloeon, could usually 
 keep out of the way. 

The mouth-parts are typically mandibulate, and in nature the 
 insect hunts for its food, swimming over the surface of the ground 
 and poking into hollows and under stones. It seems to have a 
 good sense of Â»mell, since, in swimming over the surface of the 
 mud, it will suddenly check and dive downwards ; and, in such 
 circumstances, if, the beetle is dug up, it usually has some food
