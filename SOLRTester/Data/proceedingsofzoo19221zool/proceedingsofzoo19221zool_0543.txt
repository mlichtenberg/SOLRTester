NEW SPECIES OF (ESOPHAGOSTOMUM. 467 

IS lined with chitin. The ovijectoivs lie in an antero-postevior 
 direction, being however slightly obliquely placed from side to 
 side, Inclusive of its sphincters, it measured, in a 5 15 mm. long, 
 535 jj.. The right uterus terminates in the anterior ovijector ; 
 the terminal portion of the posterior ovijector is bent slightly 
 forward, and the left uterus, which meets it, passes down the body 
 pax-allel to that of the right. 

The eggs (text-fig. Qb) are oval, thin-shelled, and of medium 
 size, measuring on an average 58 X 39 /.t. They commence their 
 development hi utero and, when laid, the embryo has just formed. 

Since writing the above description, I have obtained from 
 nodules in the cascum of a third Ground Squirrel, representatives 
 of a larval stage of 0. xeri, sp. n. These larvae were all females 
 and almost full-grown, being only slightly smaller than the adult 
 forms. From this it would appear that the larval stages, as in 
 several other CEsophagostomes, are also passed inside the tissues 
 of the digestive tract. 

From the above description it is apparent that this parasite 
 belongs to the genus (Esophagostomum ; further, the characters 
 of the mouth capsule and the oesophageal funnel with its 
 armature show that it is closely related to QJ. apiostomum. It, 
 however, differs from (E. apiostomum in two important respects : 
 namely (1) the spicules of the male ai-e much longer, measuring 
 nearly 1300 jj.^ whei-eas in (E. apiostomum thej are less than a 
 millimetre ; (2) the tail of the female is much more abruptly 
 pointed than in (E. apiostoinum ; in the latter the distance from 
 the anus to the tip of the tail is greater than that from the anus 
 to the vulva, whereas in the new form just the reverse is the case. 
 These two characters are constant in all the parasites collected, and 
 may thus be regarded as of specific significance, especially also as 
 these parasites seem to be normal in a host belonging to a group 
 of mammals from which no CEsophagostomes had previously been 
 recorded. For this parasite I propose the name 

CEsojyhagostomum xeri, sp. n., 

with the following specific description : — (Esophagostomuni. Males 
 about 13 mm. and females aboiit 15 mm. long. The maximum 
 breadth of the male is about midway, and is -^ of the total 
 length ; in the female the maximum breadth of about -^-^ the total 
 length is reached at the junction of the posterior and middle 
 thirds of the body. Cuticle transversely striated. Mouth collar 
 about twice as bi"oad as it is deep. Cervical swelling about as 
 long as it is broad. Lateral alse absent. Cervical papillae 
 situated at the level of the anterior margin of the posterior third of 
 the cesophagus. External leaf-crown of 10 elements ; internal leaf- 
 crown small, and of about twice as many elements. CEsophageal 
 funnel well-developed ; its anterior margin thickened, and carrying 
 three recurved tooth-like processes — two subventral and one dorsal.
