Bursa. — The male bursa is short and broad. It is '63 mm. in 
 length and '52 mm. in breadth. The ventral, lateral and externo- 
 dorsal rays are similarly arranged as in other members of the 
 genus. The dorsal ray is short and broad. It is '5 mm. in length. 
 It divides in its lower third into two thick branches. Each in 
 turn ends in three small and thick rays. The most lateral 
 arises separately and at higher level. The middle ray is the 
 shortest. 

Ge7iital cone. — The blunt genital cone hardly protrudes into 
 the bursa. The cloacal opening lies a little dorsal to its blunt 
 apex. 

Spictoles. — The two similar spicules are '81 mm. in length. 
 Their termination is very fine and directed ventrally. The 
 accessory piece is "19 mm. in length. Its lateral margins curve 
 forwards, forming the dorsal wall of the cloacal duct.
