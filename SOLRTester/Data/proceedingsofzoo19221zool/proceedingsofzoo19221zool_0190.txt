DR. J. STEPHEXSON ON THE MORPHOLOGY, CLASSIFICATION, 

To get a complete series of gonads in tlie ancestors of the 
 MoniligastvicUe, however, we must supply a third pair of testes 
 in the vacant segment between the two pairs already present, as 
 well as a pair of ova,ries between the last testicular segment and 
 the actual ovarian segment. That the insertion of the third pair 
 of testes is justified is seen from the presence of three pairs of 
 prostates in Synrienodrilus. One further addition is to be made- 
 three pairs of male pores imply tln^ee pairs of spermathecal j)ores 
 apposed to them in copulation. The diagram of the ancestor thus 
 becomes that shown in text-fisr. 19.

The ancestral terrestrial Oligocliffite, with complete series of gonads and 
 spermathecse. 

The above dingram probably represents an animal in which as 
 yet the moniliform series of gizzards characteristic of the family 
 had not been evolved. The gizzards are in front of the testis 
 seo'ments in Syngenodrilus, behind them in the other genera : 
 that is, the muscular wall of the oesophagus has been strengthened 
 in one place in one subfamily, in another place in the other. 

Syngenodrilus (text-fig. 16) is derived from the above form by 
 a contraction, or huddling together, of the testis segments in 
 such a way that the middle one is almost squeezed out of 
 existence a,nd the other two become testis sacs, by a corresponding 
 reduction of the number of spermathecse to two pairs opening in 
 7/8 and 8/9, and by the disappearance of the anterior pair of 
 ovaries with their funnels and ducts. 

Desmogaster (text- fig. 1 1) is derived from the common ancestor 
 by the contraction of the segments of the fii\st and third pairs 
 of testes to form testis sacs, and the disappearance of the middle 
 pairs of male organs; by a corresponding diminution in the 
 number of spermathecse, the remaining pairs opening in 6/7 and 
 7/8 ; and by the disappearance, as in Syngenodrilus, of the 
 anterior ovary with its funnel and duct. 

Eupolygaster (text-fig. 12) came into existence by the further 
 disappearance of the posterior pair of male organs and the anterior 
 pair of spermathecae of Desmogaster. 

Drciwida and Moniligaster (text-fig. 13) originated from a form 
 similar to Desmogaster by a, contraction or huddling together of 
 the testis segments like that in Syngenodrilus, but carried further.
