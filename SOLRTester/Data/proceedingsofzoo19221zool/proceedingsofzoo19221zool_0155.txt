The Naididee are a family of fresh- water Oligochseta, of small 
 size, in which the usual mode of reproduction is asexual, by 
 fission. Sexual reproduction probably occurs, at times, in all; 
 but in many, perhaps the majority, of species, and in some whole 
 genera, it has not as yet been observed. Where it has been 
 described (except in the genus Fristina, where the organs are two 
 segments further back) the testes and male funnels are in segment 
 V, the atria and male apertures, and also the ovaries, in segment 
 vi. Except in C/uetoc/asier, a single sperm-sac is constituted by 
 a posterior bulging of septum 5/6, and an ovisac, which envelopes 
 the sperm-sac, by a similar protrusion of 6/7 ; the sexual cells 
 given ofl' from the gonads enter the sacs, where they ripen, and 
 ultimately again leave the sacs to be discharged. 

Ghmtogaster is a somewhat aberrant genus of the Naididfe, 
 which was separated as a distinct family (Chaetogastridfe) by 
 Vejdovsky. It agrees, however, with the other genera of the 
 Naididfe in the prevalence of asexual multiplication, and (so far 
 as hitherto known) with the majority (all except Pristina) in the 
 position of the gonads in segments v and vi. Thus Vejdovsky 
 (6) figures and describes the testes and ovaries of C. diaphanus 
 in these segments; while Beddard (1) says that "the sperma- 
 thecpe, testes, &c., are in the same segments in both the ' families ' 
 Naidomorpha and Chfetogastridse." There appear to be no 
 detailed descriptions of the sexual organs in any species of later 
 date than these monographs, except my own of C. orientalis (4). 

The species of Chcetogaster which is commonest in Lahore in 
 N. India is that just mentioned, which I described first (3) as 
 C. pelhiciduSf but later (the specific name being preoccupied) 
 called orientalis (4). In this second paper I gave a description
