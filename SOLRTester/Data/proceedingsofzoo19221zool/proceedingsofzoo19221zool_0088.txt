consisting of two strong, very thorny, convei"ging spicules bent at 

the base in hockey-club-like fashion, one slightly larger than the 

other. Between adjacent points lie a 

pair of much smaller, straight spindles Text-fig. 10. 

longitudinally disposed, but in some 

cases there seem to be two pairs (thus 

connecting with D. dcederleini). Below 

the points there is a crown of horizontal 

spindles in two or three rows, rather 

irregularly disposed. 

The supporting bundle is strongly 
 developed, especially as regards the three 
 uppermost spindles, the lower median 
 one of which projects for almost X). jjimicea Stud. 

1 mm. 

Deduction: — A.mong the membei-s of the hemprichi group 
 there are several with only one pair of spicules in each of the 
 anthocodial points, and beside these this specimen must be 
 ranked. 

It agrees very closely with D. punicea in the following 
 features : — 

(1) each anthocodial point composed of two spicules, one 

slightly larger than the other ; 

(2) between adjacent points usually a single pair of small 

intermediate spicules ; 

(3) below the points the crown of hox^izontal spindles is present 

with two or three rows ; 

(4) the strong supporting bundle.

Desci-ibed by Kiikenthal, ' Korallentiere des Rothen Meei^es,' 
 p. 56 (1904). 

Diagnosis : — Divaricate ; contours irregular ; polyps in little 
 groups of 5-8 ; polyp stalks short ; supporting bundle medium ; 
 point spicules 6 pairs; crown absent; grade III.; spicules: canal- 
 walls show few bent rough spindles, the stalk cortex has very 
 distinctive long curved red spindles and irregular clubs, discs, and 
 spheres ; colour : rich red in the coenenchyma, anthocodial spicules 
 grey-yellow, polyp spicules of the points white. 

Anthocodial Grade and Formula : — 
 II. = 6 p -I- Cr 4- medium S.B. 

Descriptive Notes : — 

1. Colony as a ivhole. Ten specimens in all, including two 
 fine specimens agreeing closely with Kiikenthal's definition of 
 this species, the largest 40 cm. in length.
