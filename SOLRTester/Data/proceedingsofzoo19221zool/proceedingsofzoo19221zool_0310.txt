Bursa. — The bursa is long, and is indistinctly separated into 
 three lobes, especially when seen in a side view. The elongation 
 is due mainly to the dorsal lobe. The bifid ventral ray is short 
 and placed close to the cephalic end of the bursa, where it may be 
 overlooked on casual examination. 

The lateral group of rays arises by a conmon trunk, and, in 
 addition to the ordinary three branches, gives a fourth stumpy- 
 looking i-a.y. This is directed caudally. The externo-dorsal ray 
 is stout and arises close to the lateral rays. It does not reach the 
 edge of the bursa. The dorsal ray is "7 mm. long. It gives a

branch on either side after -18 mm. course. The ending of each 
 of these branches is bifid. This bifurcation can be traced for a 
 longei' distance than in P. africana. The main stem of the dorsal 
 ray after another course of '2 mm. divides into two branches 
 which end at the posterior limit of the bursa. The bursa is 
 •82 mm. long and -47 mm. broad. 

Genital cone. — This has a truncated apex. The cloacal opening- 
 is surrounded by a protruding lip, and is directed ventrally and 
 caudally. 

Spicules. — The two similar spicules are -82 mm. in leno-th.
