aperture. This leads into a long cuticular tube leading into the 
 oesophagus. The length of that part of the digestive system is 
 •1 mm. The oesophagus consists of two portions. The cephalic 
 part is thin and practically straight. It is 0-14 mm. long in the 
 male and 0-16 mm. in the female. This portion is .surrounded 
 by the nerve collar. The caudal part of the oesophagus is very 
 long and broad in diameter. It pursues a crooketl course, being 
 acutely bent from side to side. It is 1-06 mm. long in the male 
 and 1-09 in the female. Its caudal end projects into the intestine 
 and is protected by a trilobed valve.

Chyle intestine.- — The intestine pursues a straight course and 
 is lightly pigmented The rectum is narrov,- and is constricted 
 fi-om the rest of the intestine. 

Excretory fore. — This could only be made out in the female, 
 where it is 0-2-5 mm. from the head end. 

Nerve collar. — The thick nerve collar surrounds the cephalic 
 portion of the cesophagus. It is placed 0*22 mm. from the head, 
 end in the male and 0-2.3 mm, in the female. 

Genital organs. — Male : The coils of the convoluted testes lie 
 more in the longitudinal axis of the body. The long cement 
 gland curves in the caudal end of the body to end in the 
 ventral aspect of the cloaca. 

Female : The vulva lies a little cej^halad of the end of the 
 cesophagus in the mid-ventral line. At a distance of 0"1 mm. 
 from the vulval opening, the caudall}' directed vagina produces a 
 distinct U-shaped kink, and then resumes its course caudally, 
 where it is directly joined by the two uteri. The uteri proceed
