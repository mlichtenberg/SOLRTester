4. Polyp stalks are short, a little less than 1 mm. 

5. Polyps in small bundles. 

6. Polyp spicules. The anthocodial 
 armature of 8 ])oints shows 6-8 con- 
 verging pairs of small spicules, none 
 projecting, and no very definite crown, 

The supporting bundle has one strong 
 spindle up to 3 mm. in length, pre- 
 dominating and projecting for about 
 0*75 mm. 

7. Other spicides. The cortex of the 
 branches shows numerous long, straight, 
 or curved bi"ight red spindles, covered 
 with short, rather delicate, sharply 
 conical spinules, particularly crowded at 
 the ends. The coi^tex of the stalk region 
 shows («) numerous coarsely tubercu- 
 late broad spindles, straight or curved ; 
 (h) asymmetrical bent spindles, with the tubercles sti-onger on 

'the convex side ; (c) spindles with one end broadened out • 
 {d) irregular tuberculate discs, some almost spherical, others 
 almost stellate ; (e) regular and irregular triradiates (some very 
 massive). 

The canal-walls in the stalk region show numerous strong 
 triradiates and curiously irregular quadriradiates, all roughly 
 tuberculated, while besides these are minute irregularly radiate 
 forms inclining to be smooth.

A much smaller younger colony, of which the polyparium 
 measures 4 cm. by 4*6 cm., is worthy of notice because of certain 
 slight divergences. The umbellate chai^acter of the twigs is 
 much less pronounced, the whole branching is looser, the upper- 
 most pair of spindles in each point sometimes projects to a very 
 slight extent. These do not, however, differ from the others in 
 the way characteristic of D. coronaia, where the projection 
 beyond the polyp is, of course, very marked. The specimen 
 suggests that young stages of members of the Umbellatse may 
 pi-esent a somewhat Divaricate appearance. 

On the other hand, the collection includes another colony, of 
 which the polyparium measures 4-7 cm. by 4-7 cm. in maximum 
 height and breadth, which is interesting in showing the very 
 opposite vegetative characters ; for it is markedly Umbellate 
 in the bi-anching of the twigs and extremely dense in the general 
 branching, so presenting a uniform compact surface. Yet the 
 spiculation and the anthocodial armature are identical. In the
