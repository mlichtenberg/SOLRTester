 lying lanceolate red and white hairs cover tlie upper part of the 
 cephalothoi-ax ; a white fillet round the margin and only red 
 hairs round the front ej^es and on the clypeus ; above the front 
 row of eyes is a row of long brown bristles, and a thick bush of 
 long yellow-grey bristles protrudes from the lower part of the 
 clypeus and base of the mandibles, the latter being dark red- 
 brown. The lip and maxillfe are yellow-brown with yellowish 
 grey fringes. The sternum is brighter, with long upstanding 
 bristles round the ma,rgin. It is twice as long as broad, and 
 does not extend between the rear coxse.

 black-brown on the upper, with the exception of the tarsi which 
 are yellow- brown. The claw-tufts are grey. Both they and the

 hairs, and on the tibial and distal joints of the latter are long 
 outstanding yellow-grey bristles.

 that on the cephalotlioiax but white only round the base, where 
 there is also a band of long white bristles.
