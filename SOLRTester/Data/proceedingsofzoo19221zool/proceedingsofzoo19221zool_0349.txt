The upper side of all the femoral joints are embellished with 
 round brown spots in more or less longitudinal rows. 

The upper side of the pale yellow abdomen is thickly covered 
 with smooth white hair, the underlying surface being dotted like 
 the femora, with numerous rather large round brown spots. The 
 underside is somewhat similar, but the hair-covering is shorter 
 and finer and there are no brown spots. The median area is 
 iiiottled with smaller white spots. The spinnerets are bright 
 yellow. 

The cephalothorax and eyes are qviite typical of L. Koch's 
 genus. 

The lip, broader than long, is not quite half the length of the 
 maxillfe. The four teeth on the inner margin of the faix-sheath 
 are equal in size. Two on the outer margin are smaller, the 
 lower one smallest of all. Besides the tarsal scopula, a rather thin 
 one runs about half-way up the metatarsus of all legs. 

Underneath the tibia and metatarsus of each leg are two pairs 
 of powerful spines 2| millimetres long besides others shorter. 
 The claws are stout and well curved, with four pectinations. 

The abdomen is truncate in front and rather pointed pos- 
 teriorly.

It will be noted that the second and fourth pairs of legs are 
 equal and longest, 6| times the length of the cephalothorax. 
 In P. gracilis L. K. the first pair of legs are longest, 7 \ times as 
 long as the cephalothorax, and there is a pattern on the abdomen. 
 In P. plumosus Dol. the legs are covered with thick bunches of 
 hair and first pair longest. In P. longipes Thor. the second pair 
 are 9 times as long as the cephalothorax. In P. isopus Thor. the 
 first, second, and fourth pairs of legs are equal in length, only 
 4 times as long as the cephalothorax, and coloration much darker, 
 especially the sides of the latter. 

This must certainly be a new species, and I have named it 
 accordingly.
