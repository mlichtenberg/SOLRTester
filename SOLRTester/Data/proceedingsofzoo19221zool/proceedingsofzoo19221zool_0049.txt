In the last thirty years most of the attempted classifications of 
 the Heptilia have been based on the structure of the temporal 
 arches. It is generally agreed that all the later reiDtiles 
 have descended from a Lower Permian ancestor or ancestors 
 that had a roofed temporal region, and the arches found in 
 later forms have manifestly resulted from a fenestration of the 
 ancestral roof. 

Many reptiles have a temporal region which has resulted 
 from one opening in the ancestral roof : others have a temporal 
 region in which two openings have been formed. If all later 
 reptiles could be classed into those with two tempoi'al openings, 
 those with only one, and those with none, and if we could be 
 quite certain that the pair of openings in those reptiles with two 
 and the single opening in those Avith one were homologous the 
 classification would be a very easy matter. Unfortunately, we 
 have a number of groups where thenatui'e of the temporal region 
 is not quite clear, and at present there is no general agreement 
 as to the origin or affinity of these groups. 

There is almost universal agreement that at least all the later 
 reptiles with two temporal openings are closely related and form 
 a natural group to which the name Diapsida has been given by 
 Osborn. In this group we have the Dinosaurs, Crocodiles, 
 Phytosaurs, Pterosaurs, Rhynchosaurs, Rhynchocephalians, and 
 the primitive order I added a few years ago, the Eosuchia. 
 There is also general agreement that the Mammal-like reptiles 
 with a single temporal opening form a second natural group. 
 But we are left with the following important orders, concerning 
 which there is doubt — Ichthj^osauria, Plesiosauria, Placodontia, 
 Chelonia, and Lacertilia. 

The Ichthyosaurs, Plesiosaurs, and Placodonts agree in having 
 a single temporal opening. The doubt is whether this single 
 0]>ening is homologous with the single opening in the temporal 
 region of the Mammal-like reptiles. The very large majority of 
 morphologists are of opinion that it is — I think it is not. 

The Chelonians have a temporal region which looks as if it 
 had never been fenestrated at all, but merely in many types 
 encroached on from behind or below. Some hold that the 
 temporal region is still a simple roofed one. But there are 
 at least two other possibilities. The Chelonians may be derived 
 from an ancestor which had one temporal opening like the 
 Plesiosaur, or two as in Sphenodon,, Avhere the openings had 
 become secondarily closed, or they may have originated from an
