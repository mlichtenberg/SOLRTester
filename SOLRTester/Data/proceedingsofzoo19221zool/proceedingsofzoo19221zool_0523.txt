The Sympathetic Nervous System. 

Both superior cervical ganglia (text-fig. 19, S.C.G) are pi-esent 
 and communicate with the glosso-pharyngeal, vagus, hypoglossal 
 and superior laryngeal nerves (b), and the cervical plexus (C.C.P) 
 Branches run to the pharyngeal (P.P) and carotid (C.A.P' 
 plexuses.

Posterior thoracic and abdominal parts of the vagus nerves. G.B : gastric branches ; 
 S.P. and So.P: branches to solar plexus; Sp.P : to splenic plexus; S.M.P .- to 
 superior mesenteric plexus ; S.Il.P : to left suprarenal plexus. 

The middle cervical ganglion (text-fig. 20, M.C.G) is onlv 
 present on the right side, and the Annulus of Vieussens (A.Y) is 
 interposed between the sympatiietics at the root of the neck and 
 the inferior cervical ganglia (I.C.G). The Annulus on each side 
 encircles the subclavian (S.A) and vertebral (V.A) arteries. 

No fusion occurs between the vagus and sympathetic in the 
 neck, and the communications between them take place at the 
 extremities of the cervical course. The left sympathetic gives off 
 cardiac nerves (C.B.S) at the root of the neck, and the right one 
 gives ofi' a cardiac cord from its middle ganglion (C.B.S'), tracheal 
 nerves (T.N), and communicating to the right recurrent larynoeal 
 nerve (C.R.L.N). "^ ^ 

The inferior cervical ganglia give off ascending branches which 
 accompany the vertebral arteries (V.A.N) and transverse twio-.s 
 which run to the brachial plexus (O.B.P). The main sympathetic 
 cords emerge from their posterior parts (T.C.S).
