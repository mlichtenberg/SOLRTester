Since Cobbold's admirable work on the parasites of the Indian 
 elephant in 1882, our knowledge of the Helminths harboured 
 by this species of elephant has been considerably enlarged 
 by Lieut.-Col. 0. Lane, Railliet &, Henry, and others. Little 
 advance has been made regarding the parasites of the African 
 elephant. The new species recorded here, with one exception, 
 are parasites of the latter animal. 

The material upon which this study is based was collected by 
 Prof. Leiper in Uganda as far back as 1909 from two elephants 
 shot by him. In addition, specimens received from Dr. J. J. 
 Simpson, West Africa, the Raymond Laboratories in India, and 
 from Lieut.-Ool. C. Lane, the latter 's representing most of his type- 
 species from the Indian elephant, were available for study and 
 comparison. Leiper eniagalehi was collected by Prof. Leiper from 
 an Indian elephant that died in the London Zoological Society's 
 Gardens. 

Besides all this unique material, Prof. Leiper placed at my 
 disposal his extremely valuable notes on the type-species in the 
 Vienna and Berlin Natural History Museums. These proved to 
 be of great assistance with regard to Belascaris lonchoptera 
 Diesing, and Murshidia Uiisfoioi, sp. n. 

I feel deeply indebted to Prof. Leiper for his unrestricted 
 generosity and ever-ready help both as regards material and 
 information, without either of which this work could not have 
 been done. 

The nematode parasites of the elephants are peculiar to these 
 hosts, and it is an interesting fact that the parasites found in the 
 African and Indian elephants never belong to the same species. 
 Orammocejyhalus clathratus, which was formerly supposed to occur 
 in botii species of elephants, has lately been shown by Lane to 
 be represented in the Indian elephant by a separate species, 
 Mttrshidia falci/era is another example. In this paper it is 
 shown that the African elephant harbours two species of Mtir- 
 shidia, one of which apparently was mistaken for Mtirshidia 
 falcifera.

 brief diagnoses were given of two new genera and seven new species which are here 
 fullv described and illustrated.
