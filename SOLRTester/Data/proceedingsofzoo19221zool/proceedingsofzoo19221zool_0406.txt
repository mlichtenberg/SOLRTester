334 MR. G. BLAIXE ON THE ZEBRAS 

•Colony, all shot by Mr. Selous — one an old inale, stuffed, in the 
 Public Gallery, and tiie other three stuffed heads of females from 
 which the skulls have recently been removed. 

A desci-iption of the heads will suffice, as the colour and its 
 distribution on the bodies of Springbvicks does not appear to vary. 

The male has no trace of a triangular reddish-fawn patch on 
 the forehead, the face being entirely white. The latei'al cheek- 
 stripes are distinct, but nari'ow and continued above the eyes to 
 the bases of the horns. The eai-s are comparatively small, 
 146 mm. from notch to tip. The horns are basally stout, lyrate, 
 and strongly annulated, iiaving a perceptible spiral tendency 
 which might be termed an interrupted spiral. They rise at an 
 olituse angle with the frontal plane, so that a line drawn per- 
 pendicularly through the centre of the orbits falls within their 
 a,xis. The tips are hooked backwards and inwards. 

Of the females, one is without the triangular fawn frontal 
 patch. The other two show it pale and indistinct. Ear fi'om 
 notch to tip 133 mm. The horns are short, thin, nearly straight, 
 and hooked either forward or forward and inward at the tips, 
 with indistinct annulatioiis. 

In the male the skull is relatively short, wide, and deep, with 
 liorn-pedicles upright. The frontal profile is concave, with promi- 
 nent ends to the nasals. The lacrymal pits are very deep. 
 Basally the palatal surface is convex, and the basioccipital has 
 greater breadth and length. The skulls of the females are 
 similar in character.

A staffed head of a male from N. Kalahari in the Selous col- 
 lection resem.bles the Angolan Springbuck in size, length of face, 
 and in having the frontal patch and the horns more nearly in line 
 with the frontal plane. B.M. no. 19.7.15.333. 

A female from N. Bechuanaland in the same collection shows 
 the same characters as the above, and has long, straight horns, 
 hooked slightly inwards at the tips, but not so perfectly annulated 
 as in the Angolan females. B.M. no. 19.7.15.334.
