328 MR. G. BLAINE ON THE ZEBRAS 

vegetables from his carefull}^ tended garden at Equimiiia, sent up 
 to my camps by relays of cari-iers, helped to smooth over many 
 minor discomforts, and enabled me to look back upon this trip 
 as one of the most interesting and delightful of my African 
 adventures. 

Without some elementary knowledge of geology, it is difficult 
 to give a description of a country whose outstanding featui-es are 
 bare i"ock and sand. Having very little, I must, therefore, be 
 excused for a tenative and sketchy account of its outlines, which 
 ai'e so strange, wild, and rugged as to merit a description. 

After passing the mouth of the Copoi'oUa River below Dombe 
 Gi-ande, the littoral plain disappears, and gives place to high lime- 
 stone cliffs alternating, as at Elephant Bay, with red sandstone. 
 The coast-line here is indented with snmll bays bordering bush- 
 covered sandy flats, which run inland for a space of 2 or 3 
 miles and are bounded by cliffs. Numerous dambas, or dry 
 water-courses, debouch into these bays through steep defiles worn 
 in the encircling walls of rock. Access to the country behind is 
 only practicable up one of these dambas, as any attempt to climb 
 to the top of the cliffs and thence proceed across country involves 
 the surmounting of an appalling series of obstructions ; but by 
 plodding patiently along a damba through all its intricate 
 windings, one is eventually rewarded by reaching a country 
 where it is possible to follow the direction that one fancies. 

The lower reaches of these dambas are contained by perpen- 
 dicular walls of " pudding-stone " conglomerate. As they continue 
 upwards, the cliffs give way to precipitous slopes of cretaceous 
 rocks. Finally becoming shallower, they pass between undulating 
 ridges covered with loose stone and shale, merging on to sandy 
 flats, whence they break out into a network of dry water- 
 courses. 

At this point the terrain expands into many little plains which 
 are more or less confluent, having a central nucleus traversed by 
 an uninterrupted level stretch from 12 to 15 miles long. These 
 plains spread laterally into irregular bays and gulfs, and send out 
 long corridors through rocky defiles to end in dambas which lose 
 themselves among the hills. Encompassing them on every side 
 are steep stony ridges and conical kopjes built up of gneisses and 
 mica-schists, with huge outcrops of white quartz occasionally 
 crowning their summits. 

A moraine of loose fragments of glistening white quartz litters 
 the lower slopes between the hills. Elsewhere large surfaces of 
 undulating ground are thickly spread with the same debris, 
 which reflects a blinding glare fi'om the pale metallic blue of 
 the sky. 

There are no trees to cover the nakedness of the land, but pale 
 green thorn-bushes of the wait-a-bit variety, nearly all having 
 hard hooked thorns, with some cactus and euphorbia, are dotted 
 more or less evenly about this country, the pecvdiar features of
