MENDELIAN EXPERIMENTS ON FOWLS. 359 

In this case the piles would be as before, and there would be no 
 improvement. 

But the pile might be 

XYxYS X XYXY. 

Gametes XYS + xYS + XY + xY x XY. 

Progeny ... XYXYS + XYxYS + XYXY -[- XYxY. 

Therefore half the Piles would be improved by being now 
 homozygous for the combination XY instead of heterozygous. 
 At the same time the effect on the Bln,ck-red recessives from the 
 cross agrees with what fanciers say of the inferiority of such birds 
 to the pure-bred Black-red, for half of these recessives are 
 heterozygous for the XY combination.
