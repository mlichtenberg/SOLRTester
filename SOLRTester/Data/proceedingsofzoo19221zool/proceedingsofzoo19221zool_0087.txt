spindles of over 4 mm. (tlie maximum size mentioned for 
 D. gigantea) and projecting for 1*5 mm. ; 

(3) the large spindles of the supporting bundle densely covered 

with minute, blunt thorns, except for the last hnlf milli- 
 metre at the projecting • tip, which is smooth as in 
 D. gigantea ; 

(4) the spindles of the upper cortex frequently reach 4 mm. in 

length, are covered with large, blunt warts, and lie trans- 
 versely ; 

(5) the spicules of the lower cortex and of the canal-walls ; 

(6) the eight anthocodial points are often elongated and have 

the tips meeting over the polyp ; 

(7) the lowest branches of the colony show slight foliation ; 

(8) the colour-scheme of deep orange polyps and white cortex 

was found in some of the described species of D. gigantea.

3. Dendronephthya punicea (Studer). 

Described by Studer, Ann. Mag. Kat. Hist. (6) vol. i. p. 70 (1888). 

Diagnosis : — Glomerate : bundles of polyps in rounded clusters ; 
 main stem and main branches little developed ; polyps closely 
 crowded together, polyp stalks medium ; supporting bundle strong : 
 point spicules two only, strong and converging ; crown of about 
 three rows of spicjiles irregularly disposed ; grade VII. ; spicules : 
 upper cortex has big, strong, thick spindles (2 mm.), lower cortex 
 smaller and more thorny forms, including roundish and stellate 
 types ; colour : branches and all spicules scarlet ; polyps pale 
 yellow. 

Anthocodial Grade and Formula : — 

VI. = 2 P + 3 Or + strong S.B. 
 Descriptive JSToxes : — 

1. Colony as a whole. A handsome Glomerate colony, with the 
 bundles of polyps forming rounded clusters, often well separated 
 from one another. 

2. Branching. There is relatively little development of the 
 main stem and main branches as compared with the stalks of the 
 bundles of polyps composing the clusters. It is therefore one of 
 the hemprichi group. 

3. Colouring. Branches and all spicules scarlet while the 
 polyps themselves are pale yellow. 

4. Polyp stalks and their spicules. The polyp stalks measure 
 almost 1 mm. in length, 

5. Polyps closely croAvded together. 

6. Polyp spicules. The anthocodial armature has each point
