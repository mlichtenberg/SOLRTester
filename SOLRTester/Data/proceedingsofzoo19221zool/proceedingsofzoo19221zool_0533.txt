opening, it forms a large support to the basisphenoid cartilage, 
 especially in the neighbourhood of the basipterygoid process. 
 In front this median vomer or " parasphenoid" extends forward 
 as a support to the median septum almost exactly as does the 
 mammalian vomer. 

The fossil Tetrnpod slvuU that has given us the clue to the real 
 affinity of the "meniscus" is that of ^' Seymour ia hai/lorensis'' 
 Broili, recently described by Watson. ■' Seymouria " is one of the 
 most interesting primitive fossil types ever discovered ; and

Broili, Williston, and Watson have revealed to us nearly eveiy 
 detail of its structure. There are, however, two points on which 
 one would like to remark. Williston, v. Huene, and Watson all 
 agree that Seymouria haylorensis Broili is the same animal as 
 Gonodectes favosus Cope. Cope's type skull is in the American 
 Museum, and Jiis description, though by no means such as would 
 enable anyone to identify readily a similar species, is fuller than 
 that of many types, and I cannot agree with Watson that Cope's
