piece. The longer spicule is -3 luiu. in length. It begins close to 
 the tlorsal surface, and lies paivillel to it tor about two-thirds of 
 its course. Then it bends ventrnlly to pass into the cloacal canal 
 anterior to the accessory piece. The shorter spicule is -19 mm. in 
 length. It lies by the side of the terminal portion of the longer 
 spicule. Its thick cephalic end is bent ventrally, and is tlius 
 seen in the concavity of the longer spicule. The accessory piece 
 IS -09 mm. long. Its cephalic extremity is large and rounded ; its 
 end is attenuated to a sharp point.

Leiperenia leiperi Klialil. Caudal end of male. 

The tail, — The male tail is curved, forming a semicircle. It 
 is 'SS mm. long. Its extremity is rounded ; -16 mm. from the tip 
 of the tail there are four papillae. Two of these are placed near 
 the mid-ventral line, one slightly caudal to the other. The other 
 two are placed one on either side of the tail. These are all simple 
 papillae and project very little above the surface. 

The female tail is very much longer and thinner than that of 
 the male, being -7 mm. in length ; its termination is very fine. 
 There are four papillfe on either side of the anus. Xo other 
 papillae could be detected on the female tail. 

The Embryos. — The females are viviparous ; the embryos reach 
 an advanced stage of development while they are still in the 
 uterus. Six embiyos can be seen in the uterus at one time. 
 They distend that organ enormously, and make identification of 
 the neighbouring structures difiicult, it not impossible. Some of 
 these embryos measured "52 mm. in length, and '06 mm. in
