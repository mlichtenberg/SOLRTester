tube. This larger tube, liowever, is easily vecognized as the peri- 
 toneal covering ; it consists of separate cells, shortly columnar in 
 shape, with the nuclei peripherally situated. 

The spii-al coil (coil) lies more ventrally than the rest of the 
 organ ; it is altogether ventral to the lower end of the oval sac. 
 The spiral consists of about two turns; its apex is below, so that 
 the nephridial tube followed from the nephrostome first descends 
 to the apex, and then ascends as the returning limb of the spiral. 
 On quitting the spiral coil it becomes the twisted loop, a dorsal 
 continuation of the coil, which lies b}^ the side of the lower por- 
 tion of the oval sac. Thus roughly half the vertical extent of the 
 twisted nephridial tube consists of the spiral coil which is below 
 the level of the oval sac, and half of the twisted loop, situated 
 alongside the lower part of the sac ; the total extent of the twisted 
 nephridial tube is about "55 mm. The twisted loop is retained 
 by a mesentery which joins that of the oval sac. 

The twisted loop (I0023) contracts to 12 /t in diameter at its end, 
 and joins the oval sac by the intervention of a spindle-shaped 
 portion (s/j«i.). This part of the organ is 80-100 /a in length and 
 40 /x in greatest thickness ; it is perfectly circular in transverse 
 section, has thick (7^) walls, and a lumen which may be widely 
 patent, or may be almost blocked by faintly pink-staining 
 nucleated cells. 

The oval sac (sac) is much elongated dorso-ventrally, gently 
 carved round the alimentary canal, and somewhat flattened; it is 
 the largest and most conspicuous part of the whole apparatus, 
 being •Q5--73 mm. in length and "17 mm. or more in width (in- 
 cluding its peritoneal covering). It has a very bulky coat of 
 high, clear peritoneal cells (p.), 40 /a, 60 /j. or more in height ; in 
 one case the peritoneal coat formed a layer of cells thicker 
 (•18 mm.) than the whole of the included sac. The nuclei of the 
 peritoneal cells are at various levels. 

The muscular coat (m.) of the sac is remarkably thick — 12jU — 
 and consists principally of circular fibres. Inside the muscular 
 coat is a thin but very obvious connective-tissue coat, staining an 
 intense blue with hfematoxylin, about 1 /a thick. The epithelial 
 lining (ep.) consists of lightly staining low columnar or cubical 
 cells; its height is about 12 fx. — about as thick as the miiscular 
 coat. 

A mesentery, about -32 mm. in width, passes from one border 
 of the sac to the septum ; it consists of a layer of blue-staining 
 connective tissue, continuous with that of the wall of the sac and 
 Avith that of the septum, covered on both faces by peritoneal 
 cells. 

The spindle-shaped portion is similar in its structure and its 
 mesenteric relations to the sac. 

The terminal duct (d.) has a length of -S-'SS mm. in its course 
 from the ventral end of the oval sac to the body -wall, and its 
 diameter is 40 /j-. It comes ofi' just to one side of the ventral end
