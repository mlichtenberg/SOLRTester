too-etlier by string or narrow adhesive tape. Tlie cell was formed 
 between these two glasses, a strip of cotton-wool filling up the 
 open ends between the two plates and a similar strip being pushed 
 down into the nairow angle where the two plates came together, 
 and this cell was tlien filled up with sand (v. PJ. III. tig. 5). 
 By keeping the cotton-wool moist by occasional wetting, the sand 
 was also kept moist and in a suitable condition for the require- 
 ments of tlie larva or pupa of Felohius. 

An artiticial burrow was then made perpendicularly downwards 
 in the sand with a pencil, which, of course, after penetrating the 
 sand for about 2 inches, came into contact on either side with the 
 o-lass plate ; and into this burrow a larva was pushed uncere- 
 moniously, the entrance to the burrow being then closed by 
 covering the surface of the sand with a narrow strip of glass. 
 The larva was thus in such a position that whichever way it 
 worked it was compelled to form its cell in contact with 
 the glass. 

These olass cells were kept in the dark so that the larva should 
 not be worried by the light, but I found that when once the larva 
 had accepted the situation, the light did not affect it unless it was 
 very intense. 

In starting its burrow, the larva digs itself in head first, and 
 having reached the depth at which it is going to make its cell, 
 a depth which varies from 2 inches to at least 5 under different 
 soil conditions, it moves its head from side to side and, with its 
 jaws, chews up the pellets of earth, causing the grains topack 
 more closely, and in this way it forms a space around itself. 
 Practically the whole space of the cell is produced by this re- 
 arrangement of the minute particles of soil, though the entrance 
 from the tunnel becomes closed during the operation. 

At first the larva, in a straight tunnel, is rather confined in its 
 movements, but, as soon as space permits, it changes its position 
 and sits up, alternately chewing up the pellets of soil and 
 pressing them into the walls, using its head as a ram. The three 
 " tail "' processes, which one would expect to be very much in the 
 way in the confined space, become very useful. They are bent 
 over the back, like a Squirrel's tail, and wedged against the wall 
 of the cell, and on them the body turns about freely ni all 
 directions (v. PI. III. figs. 1 & 2). . , , 

The work of constructing the cell usually took from twelve to 
 fifteen hours, though sometimes two or three days seemed to be 
 necessary ; but in these cases the larva seemed to work inter- 
 mittently and without enthusiasm, whereas in most cases great 
 energy was shown and no rest taken until the cell was completed. 
 After the completion of the cell the larva rests for from six to 
 eleven days (v. PI. HI- fig- 3) before it changes into a white 
 pupa of the usual Coleopterous type. The pupal period lasts 
 about sixteen days, and the imago, white at first, take,:, twelve 
 hours or longer to attain its colours, and remains m the cell for a 
 week or more before breaking out.
