Quilonia renniei Ihle, 1919. 

Tlie main features of this species, as described by Evans and 
 Rennie and also l)y Lane, are: (a) the leaf-crown projects freely 
 above the head, (h) the leaflets are thin and long, (c) the dorsal 
 ray bifurcates low down in the bursa, and (d) its tri-radiate final 
 branches are very thin and arise at different levels. (For 
 measurements see Table II.) 

Habitat. Caecum of the Indian elephant (India).

The leaf -crown does not project above the head. It consists 
 of ten rays. The branches of the dorsal ray are stouter and 
 longer than in Q. renniei. (For measurements see Table II.,

Quilonia apiensis Lane, 1921. 

This parasite was recorded by Gedoelst unaccompanied by figures, 
 la the genus Quilonia it is extremely difficult to differentiate 
 species on description o)ily. Lane, in describing Q. africana, 
 expressed his regret that Q. apiensis was recorded without figures. 
 The same difliculty was experienced in examining the material 
 at my disposal without a full knowledge of Q. a2yiensis. Later, 
 Prof. Gedoelst very generously sent co-type material of his species 
 to be added to Prof. Leiper's collection. This made possible a 
 complete description of the species with camera-Iucida drawings. 

Material. — The material consisted of 25 specimens labelled 
 Quilonia apiensis (co-types) from Prof. Gedoelst. Of these, eight 
 specimens are kept in the Helminthological collection of the 
 London School of Tropical Medicine. In addition, three speci- 
 mens were identified by me in Prof. Leiper's material. 

Shape of body. — The body is straight, slender, and tapei'ing 
 towards either end. The male is 16 mm. long and the female is
