PARASITES OF ELEPHANTS. 221 

cephalad of the bursa, the female tapeis caiidad to a fine point. 
 The head is discoid in shape. Tiie oral aperture is bounded by 
 two sliglitly marked lateral lips, each carrying a sessile lateral 
 and two prominent submedian papillae. The oral capsule is 
 roughly cylindrical, and circular in cross section, while the wall 
 varies in shape in different parts. Since this is thicker caudad 
 and thinner cephalad on its dorsal and ventral than on its lateral 
 aspects, its cavity is, at its cephalad end, wider dorso-ventrad than 
 laterodaterad. The cuticle bounding the mouth cavity is applied 
 to the mouth capsule only over its caudad portion. Along a cir- 
 cumferent^al line, which is further cephalad on the dorsal and 
 ventral than on the lateral walls, the cuticle turns axo-cephalad 
 and splits into rays having a similar direction ; and since further 
 these rays are shorter dovsally and ventrally than latei-ally, the 
 result is that their points which form the boundary of the oral 
 aperture, do not describe a circle but produce a dorso-ventral slit. 
 The oesophagus is fairly short, widening caudad of the nerve- 
 collar. Its caudal end is guarded by three intestinal valves. The 
 boundaries of the cells of the chyle intestine are more marked 
 than usual. The cephalic and the cervical glands are large and 
 well developed. The lateral cervical papillae are long, slender, 
 and project somewhat cephalad. 

" The male expands ventrad just cephalad of the bursa. The 
 number of bursal rays is as usual. The externo-dorsal rays lie 
 close to the lateral rays. The doi'sal ray is deeply cleft in the 
 mid-line, and ea.ch half is composed of three subdivisions. There 
 nppear to be no pre-bursal papillae. The spicules are equal and 
 similar, and the head of each is bent like the head of a golf- 
 driver, while the shaft may be straight or may be bent near the 
 point. There is a colourless thickening of the cuticle in the 
 position of the accessory piece, which is S-shaped in lateral optical 
 section. The other male organs are as usual. 

" The female has a long and pointed tail, the vulva lying shortly 
 cephalad of the anus. The vagina runs cephalad and divides into 
 two uteri, which have the same direction, are provided with 
 ovejectors, run parallel Avith one another, and end abruptly in the 
 two cephalad-running ovai^es." 

I may add to this that an accessory piece is present, and 
 although the male is broad just above the bursa, this is not 
 always the greatest diameter of the body. 

Type-species, Murshidia murshida. 

Mtjrshidia murshida Lane, 1914. 

This nematode has the general characteristics of the genus. 
 The external leaf-crown consists of sixty leaflets. The vulva has 
 a cuticular prominence both cephalad and caudad of it. (For 
 measui'ements vide Table I., p. 228.) The latei'al and dorsal rays 
 of the bursa have a rugged outline and a bulbous origin.
