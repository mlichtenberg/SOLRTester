17. Dendronephthya pumilio (Studer). 

Described by Studer in Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist. (6) vol. i. pp. 70- 
 71 (1888). 

Diagnosis: — Umbellate; branches in rounded bunches closely 
 packed ; outline uniform ; general shape flat to globose ; polyps 
 on the terminal twigs; polyp stalks long; supporting bundle 
 very strong; point spicules about 5 pairs, the uppermost 
 elongated ; no crown ; grade IV. ; spicules : lower coi-tex has 
 thick, bent, thorny spindles but no distinct stars ; colour : 
 generally yellowish white, polyps dark red, the tentacles densely 
 crowded with minute rod-like reddish spicules. 

Anthocodial Grade and Formula :-^ 

lY. = I + 4p + 0Cr+ very sti^ong iS.B. 

Descriptive Notes : — 

1. Colony as a ivhole. Four interesting sjjecimens at dift'erent 
 stages of growth, the largest having the following dimensions: — 
 Total height 16 cm., height of sterile stalk 6-5 cm., breadth of 
 polyparium 9"5cm. The colony is very markedly umbellate in 
 its largest forms, but less so in the younger forms, which tend 
 to be much flattened. 

2. Branching. The branches form rounded bunches, closely 
 packed together and forming in the larger colonies a markedly 
 uniform contour. The general shape varies from flat to globose, 
 and I do not think that any importance can be attached to 
 this. 

3. Colouring. Yellow white, polyps Text-fig. 24. 
 dark red. 

4. Polyp stalks long. /**'. 

5. Pohji^s arranged on the terminal 
 twigs. 

6. Poly20 spicules. The anthocodial 
 ai-mature is marked by the elongation of 
 one or both of the terminal spicules of 
 each point, the others, to the number 
 of 2 or 3 pairs, being markedly sub- 
 ordinate. This is my grade TV. There 
 is no crown. 

The tentacles are long and heavily 
 armoured, bearing dorsally a crowd, 
 sometimes bilinear, of minute oval or D. pumilio ^iwA. 

rod-like reddish spicules. 

The supporting bundle is very strong, the largest spindle often 
 projecting for 1 mm. The spicules are finely and thickly spmose, 
 and often shoAv smooth points. In many cases one polyp and its 
 supporting bundle may be seen to predominate markedly over 
 the others in the group. 

7. Other spicules. The spicules of the lower cortex are mostly 
 thick spindles, usually bent, and densely covered with strong,
