of the oval sac, is straight and stiff, and- makes a right angle or 
 rather less with the general direction of the sac (except where 
 the duct has the lower opening, v. inf.). 

In whole preparations of the nephridium the ectal end, where 
 it is broken off from the body-wall, always appears trumpet- 
 shaped, the end of the trumpet being oblique and the dorsal lip 
 the more prominent {tr., fig. 1). The duct is covered by a layer 
 of cubical peritoneal cells ; the remaining layers are the same as 
 those of the oval sac, but all are thinner ; the lining epithelium 
 consists of approximately cubical slightly staining cells. 

The duct is attached by a narrow mesentery to the posterior 
 face of the septum. Reaching the angle between the septum 
 and the parietes it dilates somewhat, the dilatation corresponding 
 to the trumpet-shaped ending of the duct as seen in the isolated 
 nephridium (v. sup.). 

The duct may reach the body- wall in one. of two situations — 
 either at the level of the lateral or of the ventral setse ; in the 
 first case it makes an angle ra,ther less than a right angle with 
 the axis of the oval sac, while in the second it appears as a direct 
 downwai'd continuation of the sac. . At both these levels the 
 long•it^dinal muscular coat shows an interruption in transverse 
 sections;- the trximpet-shaped dilatation rests therefore on the 
 cii'cular muscular coat. 

If the duct has the lower position, it penetrates the parietes 
 forthwith ; the blue-staining layer becomes continuous with the 
 similar layer of the body-wall, and the epithelium of the duct 
 with the superficial epithelium of the body. The same may 
 happen if the duct reaches the body-wall at the level of the 
 lateral sette — the duct may penetrate the parietes immediately, 
 in a slightly upward direction. Often, however, the duct 
 continues in the body-wall in an upward direction, and reaches a 
 level not very far from the mid-dorsal line— a level corresponding 
 approximately on the dorsal to that of the ventral setee on the 
 ventral side— before it comes to the surface. 

In the latter case the muscular layer of the duct ceases to be 
 distinguishable; the blue-staining layer becomes continuous with 
 a very marked similarly staining layer between the circular and 
 longiti^dinal muscular coats of the body- wall ; and the epithelial 
 layer of the duct is only distinct at the beginning and end of its 
 course within the wall.. For- .the- greater joart of this course the 
 duct appears rather like a. split in the . body-wall immediately 
 internal to the circular muscular layer ; the epithelial layer is 
 difllcult to make out (except at the two ends), and the lumen of 
 the duct appears in most parts to be bounded by a vei-y definite 
 wall of the blue-staining connective tissue. • 

I give below the positions of the endings of the nephridial 
 ducts in a consecutive series of eleven segments, both on the 
 right and left sides. . It will be noted that there are no apertures 
 in the lowest position (on the level of the ventral setse) on the 
 left side and none in the dorsal position on the right side.
