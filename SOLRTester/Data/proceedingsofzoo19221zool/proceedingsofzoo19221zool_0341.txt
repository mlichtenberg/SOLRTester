The spiders described below were collected by Mr. C. Boden 
 Kloss in the course of a joui-ney among the hills in S. Annam, 
 in the spring of 1918. He has very kindly sent them to me for 
 identification. 

Family Aviculariid^e. 

Genus Macrothele Auss. 

Macrothele maculata Thor., var. annamensis, var. nov. 

Dr. Thorell described as a new species, named as above, a non- 
 adult female from Java, placing it in C. Koch's genus Diplwa. 
 There is no doubt about it belonging to the present genus. Of 
 the two specimens here recorded, one is probably adult and the 
 other certainly not. They agree closely with Thorell's description, 
 with the exception that his specimen had two rows of white spots 
 on the back on a black ground, while in these the spots are 
 wanting . 

He further states that the eye area is 2-1- times as broad as 
 long. In these it is barely twice as broad, meaning that the 
 space between the front and rear rows has slightly widened. As 
 I believe this may be caused during growth to maturity, I have 
 merely deemed this a variety, due to the want of spots, instead 
 of, as it would otherwise have to be, a new species. There are 
 two females from Langbian Peaks, S. Annam, 6500 ft. 

Family Zobarid^. 

Subfamily Storenomorphin^. 
 Genus Storenomorpha Sim. 

Storenomorpha comottoi Sim. 

I have little doubt that a male and female from the same 
 locality as the foregoing belong to M. Simon's above-named 
 species, whicli he records from Burma. 

The minute third claw is little more than a plate with a small 
 point. It is close up to the scopula and very difficult to see at 
 all. All three claws spring from a hollow at the end of the 
 joint.
