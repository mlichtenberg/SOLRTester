(2) The Testis Sacs (Sperin-sacs). 

Beddard describes the sperm-sacs of U. harwelli (6). Pie 
 makes the interesting suagestion contained m _ the iollowing 
 extract (postscript to 6) :— " The remarkable partial obliteration 
 of a segment (the xiiith) wliich Michaelsen has recently described 
 iii Nemertodrihis griseus, suggests that something of the same 
 kind may have occurred in the Moniligastrid^e, the supposed, 
 sperm-sacs may be all that is left of the ccelom belonging to the 
 segment which contains the testes. This is, of course, no more 
 than a suggestion ; but the varying position of the essential 
 organs in the Oligochseta requires, as I point out m a forthcoming 
 number of the ' Quarterly Journal of Microscopical Science, some 
 possibility of the intercalation or excalation of segments at_ tne 
 head end." The sacs are also described by Benham m B. tndi- 
 ctos (10) where the cavity is traversed by muscular fibres passing 
 in different directions ; and by .Bourne in D. grandis (11). 
 ' As in all species of the genus Drcmida, the testis sacs, 
 containing the testes, male funnels, and ripening spermatozoa, 
 are in the present species a single pair, suspended by septum J 10. 
 In some species of the genus they, project about equally into 
 segms. ix and x, in some they project forwards into ix more than 
 backwards into x ; often there are differences on the two sides- 
 individual differences, not specific. In the pi;esent species the 
 sacs proiect backwards more than forwards. The appearance is 
 somewhat, as if the septum had split, the sacs being cavities 

within "it (fig. 2). • „ , i xi i 

Both anterior and posterior walls of the sac have the usual 
 peritoneal (p.), connective^tissue, and muscular («.. components 
 The inner lining of the sac is in places a cubical or flattened 
 epithelium {ep.) ; over the greater part of the wall, however, the 
 lining is not distinguishable from the mass of cells which fils the
