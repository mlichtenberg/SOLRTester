PARASITES OF ELEPHANTS. 229 

The oral aperture is surrounded by a cu-cle of converging rays. 
 The mouth capsule is large and like a funnel in shape. Rounded 
 cuticular prominences protrude into the oral cavity. 

Male : The most striking featui-e of the bursa is an accessory 
 ray projecting from tJie dorsal aspect of the main stem of tlie 
 lateral ray. The two spicules are similar and equal. There is 
 an accessory piece. Railliet wrongly recorded that the dorsal 
 ray divides into four branches instead of tliree. 

Female : The vulva is close to the anus, where the worm 
 suddenly narrows. The tail is bluntly conical.

 Asifia vasifa Lane, 1914. 

Tlie male measures 14 mm. in length, with a maximum diameter 
 near the head of 0*75 mm. The spicules are 2-0 mm. in length. 

The female is 19 mm. in length, with a maximum diameter of 
 1 -0 mm. The vagina runs cephalad, joining the two parallel uteri. 
 The ova measure 50 jx by 25 fx. 

Habitat. Otiecum of the Indian elephant (India).

Fairly slender worms ; the head discoid, the mouth terminal 
 and surrounded by two sessile lateral and four prominent sub- 
 median papillae. The rays of the external leaf-crown are few 
 and characteristically curved. The cuticular lining of the oral 
 cavity does not lie directly in contact with the chitinous mouth 
 capsule. The mouth-ojDening is narrower than the diameter of 
 the oral cavity. The ossophagus is nearly cylindrical in shape. 
 Two or more teeth project into the oral cavity. 

Male : The bursa is more or less distinctly divided into three 
 lobes. The dorsal lobe is longer than the lateral lobes. The 
 bui'sal rays are the usual number. The dorsal ray is bifurcate, 
 ea,ch branch having three subdivisions. The spicules are equal 
 and similar, and each has a sickle-shaped point. The accessor}^ 
 piece is curved from side to side, the concavity being ventrad. 
 Seen from the dorsum it is wider cephalad than caudad. 

Female : The vulva is in the caudal third of the body. The 
 uteri are opposed, divergent and furnished with marked ovejectors. 
 The caudad uterus turns cephalad immediately beyond its 
 ovejector. Tlie two uteri run cephalad side by side. Brown
