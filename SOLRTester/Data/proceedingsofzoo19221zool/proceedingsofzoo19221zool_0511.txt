from the lateral two-thiixls of the axillary border of the scapula, 
 and some fibres fuse with the proximal part of the dorso-epitro- 
 chlearis. The two humeral heads have extensive areas of origin. 
 The strong tendon of insertion passes to the dorsal aspect of the 
 extremity of the olecranon, but some fibres pass along the side 
 of the tendon to be attached to the proximal inch of the lateral 
 border of the ulna. 

As the hands were not at my disposal, no attempt was made to 
 dissect out the muscles of the forearm. 

The sartorius arises from a narrow area, on the ventral border 
 of the ilium ; and its origin bounds an axch through which the

lateral cutaneous nerve of the thigh emerges. It is inserted into 
 the front of the shaft of the tibia distal to the insertion of the 
 qua.driceps extensor. To reach that point it describes a curve 
 like the italic /*. It helps to bound three triangles â€” a deep 
 Scarpa's Triangle whose boundaries areas in Man, a triangle whose 
 other boundaries are the adductor longus and gracilis, and a tri- 
 angle whose other boundaries are the quadriceps tendon and 
 internal femoi'al condyle. In the latter triangle the tendon of 
 the adductor magnus is seen passing the internal condyle to reach 
 the tibia (text-fig. 13).
