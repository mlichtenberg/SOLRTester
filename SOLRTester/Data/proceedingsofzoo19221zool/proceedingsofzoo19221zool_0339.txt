3. Granuloma of kidney. — These two cases were in a waxwing

 and had lived for 18 years in the Gardens. 

4. Stomatitis. — This shows a decrease. 

5. Perfoi-ation of gizzard. — Both cases were due to pieces of 

wire and wei^e found in ground-feeding birds. 

6. Enteritis. — This is really a group of diseases due to various 

causes, all resulting in inflammation of the intestines. 
 The causes are at present unknown. 

7. Constipation. — A remarkable case occurred in a peccary. 

The coils of intestine were adherent to one another, 
 thereby causing a vicious circle. There was nothing to 
 indicate which was the primary condition.

spotted cavies. 

9. Myeloid degeneration of liver. — In a double-striped Thicknee.

 pneumonia and ulceration of intestine.

incidence this year.
