336 MR. G. BLAINE ON THE ZEBRAS 

detected. Altliougli probably not more than ten days old, it 
 jumped up and trotted ofi" witli characteristic stilty action, bead 
 between forelegs, nrched back, and with the white dorsal crest 
 erected and spread like an open fan. I followed tvnd it cantered 
 aAvay, mnking miniature bounds in the air, in perfect mimicry of 
 an adult Springbuck. 1 encountered several more dming that 
 day, and they all Avent through the same acrobatic performance,, 
 nor were any of the natives with me fleet enough to run one 
 dovrn.

Besides Springbuck, the following Antelopes were seen within 
 20 miles of the coast: — Eland, Kudu, Gemsbuck [Oryx gazella),. 
 Steinbuck, Klipspringer, and Dik-Dik. Also Chapman's Zebra.. 
 Of these, the Eland and Chapman's Zebra were visitors that had 
 wandered down from the interior, attracted by the fine green 
 grass which had sprung up during the season of light intermittent 
 I'ains that fall between the months of December and April. The 
 remainder are regular denizens of this barren region. 

Oevx gazella. 

Above all other Antelopes the Gemsbuck seems to embody the 
 spirit of the African veldt. He is at home in vast shadeless 
 spaces under a fiery sun, reared on the pale desert grass and 
 sheltered by the scanty wait-a-bit thorn. The Kudu is more- 
 graceful, the Sable moi'e magnificent, the Eland more stately, but 
 the Gemsbuck has a character all his own. He is thoroughbred 
 of the desert. His classic outline suggests some hunting scene 
 depicted on an Assyrian bas-relief. Energy, strength, endurance 
 are the key-notes of his conformation. His frame is massive- 
 without being heavy, and, although devoid of hollows and angles,, 
 does not carry an ounce of superfluous flesh arid is supported upon 
 light clean-boned limbs. The straight rapier-like horns, dark 
 brilliant eye, and clean hard colour of the pelage, handsomely 
 varied with black and white, go to form, in mj' estimation, one of 
 the finest game animals in existence. This opinion I know is not 
 generally shared by others who have seen this Antelope in its 
 wild state. To me there is completeness both of character and 
 ap2?earance and such perfect adaptation to environment as always, 
 to draw my admiration. 

* Ear of $ 7 inches.
