458 MR. U. BROOM ON THE TERSISTENCE OF THE 

name should be treated as a nome)i iiiodnvi. Conodecies has eight 
 years' priority over Seynwuria, and if those wlio have examined 
 both types are satisfied that they belong to the same species, 
 I think we will have to use Cope's name Concdectes favosus in 
 preference to that of Brioli. 

The second point is a much more debatable one. Watson 
 describes " »S'e?/?>i.o?tria " as " the most primitive known reptile," 
 and everyone else who has written about the animal has also 
 been of the opinion that it is a reptile ; and until Watson's paper 
 appeared, I also accepted this opinion, having never seen any of 
 the actual specimens. I do not in the present paper wish to enter 
 at length into the discussion, but may state that the study of 
 Watson's paper leads me rather to the conclusion that Conodectes 
 is a highly evolved and specialized Embolomerous Amphibian, 
 with a very few reptile-like characters which have been acquired 
 by a parallel development. For the present, however, it matters 
 little whether Conodectes is an Amphibian-like Reptile or a Reptile- 
 like Amphibian. It certainly lets us know more of the primitive 
 Tetrapod structure than almost any othei; known type, and for- 
 tunately the palate is well known, and has been fully described 
 by Watson. 

There is a large pterygoid which meets its neighbour in front, 
 and it is supported indirectly by a basipterygoid process. Between 
 the process and the pterygoid is a distinct bony element, con- 
 cerning which Watson says : — "The short basipterygoid processes 
 of S'ei/mouria supporting the pterygoid through the intervention 
 of a special bone are unique, nothing similar occurring in any 
 other known adult reptile or amphibian. The shape and position 
 of the pterygoid render it certain that these special bones cannot 
 be the epipterygoids, which in Dimetrodon are known to articu- 
 late with the basisphenoid. Swinnei^ton and Howes showed that 
 in the development of the skull of Sphenodon special articular 
 cartilages are developed between the basipterygoid processes 
 and th.e pteiwgoid, and it is not impossible that these are the 
 representatives of the articular bones in Seymouria. 

•' On the other hand, Gaupp has shown that in Lacerta the 
 Imsipterygoid processes contain independent centres of ossification, 
 and it is feasible and attractive to regard the Seymcmria bones as 
 permanently separate autogenous basipterygoid processes." 

With regard to this second suggestion, it may be mentioned 
 that the basisphenoid in lizards and many other animals ossifies 
 for the most part from the parasphenoid, and, so far as I am 
 awai'e, no one has confirmed Gaupp's observation. Parker 
 examined an embryo Zootoca (his 6th stage) which one would 
 fancy ought to show the basipterygoid distinct if it is ossified 
 from a separate centre ; but there is no evidence of this. Howes 
 and Swinnerton figui-e a stage in the development of the skull of 
 Sphenodon (stage 8) where the basisphenoid is evidently ossified 
 from a pair of centres each of which embraces the basipterygoid
