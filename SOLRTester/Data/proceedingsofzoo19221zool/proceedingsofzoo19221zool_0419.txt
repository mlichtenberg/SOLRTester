"When I became Secretary of the Society, the practice of 
 feeding Hve animals to snakes was violently attacked, on the 
 ground of cruelty, and vigorously defended as natural and 
 necessary. I enquired into the attack and the defence. The 
 latter was easily disposed of. I could not agree that even if 
 cruelty were part of the order of Nature we were justified in 
 continuing it under artificial conditions. Nor could I accept the 
 odd opinion urged on me in particular by the late Dr. Plimmer 
 that there was merit in the flesh of prey killed by the serpent 
 itself, absent from prey killed by other means. But the question 
 was answered by practice. Mr. E. G. Boulenger, our Curator of 
 Reptiles, to whom I am much indebted for his patient and 
 ■careful observation of my suggestions, is now in agreement 
 with me that snakes do not require a living prey. 

The cruelty .dleged by the attack is a more difiicult, and from 
 the scientific point of view, more interesting question. So far as 
 I could see, frogs, rats and mice, rabbits, guinea-pigs, fowls and 
 ducks, introduced to snakes, had no sense of impending fate, and 
 treated the creatures which were going to destroy them as 
 indifferent objects. The sense of terror was in the spectators, 
 not in the victims. But I wished to carry the matter further, and, 
 with the assistance of Mr. R. I. Pocock, the Society's Curator of 
 Mammals, made a large series of experiments by introducing 
 live snakes to different kinds of animals. The results of these 
 ■observations have already been communicated to the Society 
 (P. Z. S. 1907, p. 785), and I have also repeated some of the 
 actual experiments at one of our Scientific Meetings. Except 
 in the cases of a few of the higher birds, notably parrots and 
 Passerines, and the Primates excluding Lemurs, animals show no 
 special relation of fear in the presence of living snakes, even 
 when the latter are allowed to approach them closely, protruding 
 their quivering tongues. But the reaction of fear is immediate 
 and painful to see when a snake is introduced to a parrot or 
 starling in a cage, or to anjr of the true monkeys from the South 
 American marmosets to the Great Apes. 

The instant recognition and betrayal of fear by special sounds 
 and rapid retreat, even in the case of a lethargic old Orang-utan, 
 were so plain that I was disposed to treat them as instinctive, 
 -and even went the length of suggesting tliat the human dread of 
 ■snakes might be an instinct inherited from our ape-like ancestors.
