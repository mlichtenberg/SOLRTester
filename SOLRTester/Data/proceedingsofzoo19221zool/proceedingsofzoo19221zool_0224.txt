as deep. Silveiy, witli or without dark ci'oss-bars; sometimes an 
 interi-upted lateral band ; an opercular spot ; usually a bar below 
 eye ; soft dorsal and caudal sometimes spotted ; males with ocelli 
 on anal fin. 

Several specimens, 90 to 135 mm. in total length. 

The remarkable phaiyngeal dentition might well be held to 
 justify the genus Labrocliromis (Regan, 1920), were it not that in 
 all other characters the species is nearly identical with H. cinereus.

 Lijyochromis ('Annals,' 1920).
