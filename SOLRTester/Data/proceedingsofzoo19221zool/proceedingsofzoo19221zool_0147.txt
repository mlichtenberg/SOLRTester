SYMPATHETIC NERVfiS OF THE EDENTATA. l03 

any ascending aortic branch. In addition to the communicating 
 nerves to the intercostals, and filaments to the oesophagus, aorta 
 and mediastinum, splanchnic nerves are given ofF. 

The Solar or Cmliac Ple.vus (text-fig. 2) consists of several 
 ganglia and communicating bundles of fibres, and is divisible 
 into upper and lower parts. It is connected to the sympathetic 
 cords by splanchnic nerves (h) ; these are three in number, but 
 the lowest is really a bundle of fibres. It lies betweeii the layers 
 of the mesentery, along the course of the cceliac axis, and is not 
 set across the vertebral column. The following are the branches 
 of distribution : — 

A. From the upper part of the plexus. 

1. Hepatic plexus (i) which communicates with the gastric 
 branches of the right vagus (/) by nerves meeting in a small 
 ganglion. 

2. Splenic plexus (k) communicating with the right vagus and 
 supplying spleen and pancreas. 

3. Phrenic plexus (J) communicating with the phrenic nerve in 
 the diaphragm. 

B. From the lower part of the plexus. 

1. Bight renal plexus (m). 

2. Communicating branches to the splanchnic nerves and aortic 
 plexus (n). 

The Aortic Plexus (p) accompanies the aorta and its branches. 
 It communicates with the splanchnic nerves, sympathetic cords 
 (RS and LS), and their common ganglion. And it gives oflf the 
 left renal plexus (o). 

The abdominal parts of the sympathetic have few ganglia. They 
 gradually diminish in size and meet in a common ganglion in 
 front of the sacrum. From the latter nerve plexuses run to the 
 pelvic viscera. 

Euphractus villosus (text-figs. 3 and 4). 

The vagus and sympathetic nerves differ in many ways from 
 those in Tamandua. 

The Vagus Nerves : — The ganglion nodosum (G.JST) is present 
 on both sides. And the branches of communication to the other 
 cranial nerves and the superior cervical ganglion of the sympa- 
 thetic are well marked. In the middle of the neck a thick 
 communicating branch connects the right vagus and sympathetic. 

The pharyngeal branch (a) arises above the ganglion nodosum, 
 and no nerve connects it to the hypoglossal nerve. 

The superior laryngeal nerve (h) is a thick branch arising from 
 the centre of the ganglion nodosum. It divides into a thick 
 internal laryngeal nerve {i.l.n) and a thin external laryngeal 
 nerve (e.l.n) which receives a loop from the superior cervical
