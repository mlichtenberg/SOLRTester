CHARACTERS OF SOME HYSTRICOMORPII RODENTS. 383 

edge of the cavity. The edge or rim is raised all round, defining 
 a de^p hollow divided into two by a large valvular siipratragus, 
 which separates the upper third from the lower two-thirds of the 
 cavity. There is no tragus ; but the antitragus forms a long, 
 narrow, infolded, naked ridge, from the upper end of which a 
 short ridge i-uns obliquely forwards, upwards, and inwards to 
 terminate in the middle of the cavity beneath the supratragus. 
 A corresponding ridge occupies a similar position in the anterior 
 half of the lower two-thirds of the cavity. The orifice of the 
 auditory meatus is a large hole situated just within the lower 
 half of the antitragal ridge. (Text-fig. 6, N.) 

According to Dobson, the ear of Pectinator resembles that of 
 Ctenoclaciylus except that it i-etains the antitragal thickening 
 which the latter, he alleges, has lost. Since, however, thei'e is a 
 long low antitragus in the examples of Ctenodactijlus I examined, 
 this distinction does not hold. Dobson probably overlooked this 
 structure in Ctenodactiilus owing to its being normally folded 
 inwards. Assuming that their ears are similai', these two 
 genera differ markedly not only from all the Hystricomorphs, 
 but from all other Rodents kno^vn to me in the structure of 
 this organ. 

The Feet. 

In Hystrix, Acanthion, and Atherura the fore foot is short and 
 broad. The four main digits are short, subequal, moderately widely 
 separable, and united by naked integument up to the proximal end 
 of the large smooth digital pads. The claws are tolerably long, 
 strong, and fossorial. The pollex, on the other hand, is greatly 
 I'educed and represented externally merely by its nail and small 
 pad. It arises alongside the outer distal extremity of the radial or 
 inner carpal pad, behind or abos^e the inner lobe of the plantar 
 pad. The plantar pad is smooth, about twice as wide as long, and 
 three-lobed. The median lobe projects in the middle line and 
 is larger than the lateral lobes, of which the inner is smaller 
 than tlie outer. The posterior border of the pad is almost 
 sti'aight from side to side. Immediately behind it ai-e two large 
 smooth carpal pads, separated by a naked space, or nearly in 
 contact, and behind the pads there is a short area of naked skin 
 overlapped by the bristly hairs above it. 

The digits and plantar pad of the hind foot are, in general 
 features, tolerably similar to those of the fore foot, except that 
 the hallux is better developed than the pollex and arises just in 
 front of the inner lateral lobe of the plantar pad. The sole of 
 the foot behind the plantar pad is smooth and naked back to the 
 heel, and is occupied for the most part by two large, but not well- 
 defined, metatarsal pads. (Text-fig. 8 ) 

The feet of Dinomys^ judging from the description and figures 
 published by Peters *, appear to be moi^e like, those of Ilystrix
