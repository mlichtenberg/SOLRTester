88 MR. F. BALFOUR- BROWNE ON THE LIFE-HISTORY 

the variations in colour-pattern within a species*. I have only 
 paid slight attention to the subject, and only in the case of water- 
 beetles, la many of the Hydradephaga one finds a dark ground- 
 colour marked with yellow lines or spots, and there is usually 
 considerable variation to be found within a species, some indi- 
 viduals showing more yellow and others being almost without 
 it. Such species fis Agahus ahh'eviatus Y.,A. didymus 01., and 
 Flatambus macidatus L. are most interesting studies, vihile in 
 such a genus as Deronecies four out of the five Britannic species 
 give excellent material for research. 

To return to Pelohius, In the newly-hatched larva the head is 
 moi'e or less triangular in shape and the prothorax is but little 
 nari'ower than the head, the body thereafter tapering away to 
 the last abdominal segment, which is only about one-fifth the 
 width of the headi 

The larva is heavier than water and breathes subaquatically 
 by means of a series of filamentous gills attached at the sides of 
 the sterna of the thoracic and first three abdominal segments. 
 At the inside of the base of each of the front legs is a tuft of 
 three gill-filaments. Four rather larger filaments lie inside the 
 bases of the middle legs, and the two posterior legs have each a 
 tuft of three gills situated as in the case of the anterior legs. 
 The abdominal gills consist each of a pair of filaments arising 
 from a common base, and one of these is attached on each side to 
 the posterior edge of the stei-nite, those of the first abdominal 
 segment Ij^ing posterior to the pair of embryonic appendages 
 already referred to. 

The gills are tracheate, Avith a single unbranched tube running 
 the length of each filament. 

The legs are long and delicate. The coxa is large, the 
 trochanter consists of two small segments, and the femur, tibia, 
 and tarsvis are each of one segment, the tarsus bearing a pair of 
 claws almost as long as the segment. The tarsus in each case, 
 but more especially of the second and third pairs of legs, is 
 strongly feathered, and therefore forms an eflicient swimming- 
 organ ; but it has also another function. Gilled insect nymphs 
 and larvae, resting in stagnant water, usually adopt some means 
 of circulating the water about the respii-atory apparatus. 
 Agrionid dragonfly nymphs Avill frequently lash the abdomen 
 from side to side ; the nymphs of the Ephemerid, Chloeov. flap 
 the lamellate gills ranged along the sides of the abdomen, and the 
 larvfe of certain Perlids " dance " up and down, lajsing and 
 lowering the body betAveen the legs. The larvae of Pelobms use 
 their feathered legs as fans, the middle leg on one side and the 
 anterior and posterior legs on the other being raised off the
