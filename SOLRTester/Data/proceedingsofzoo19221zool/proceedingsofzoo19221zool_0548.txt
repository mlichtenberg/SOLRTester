are of quite special interest, as tliey are (so far as the writer 
 knows) the first insect hyperpai-asites of any kind recoi-ded from 
 Nycteribiidte *. The J^JujJelm'us belongs to a group some members 
 of which are parasitic on scale-insects (Coccidae), and it is 
 remarkable that the puparia of the Cydo'podia themselves bear 
 a very strong superficial I'eseniblance to certain scale-insects 
 which are pai'asitised by other forms of Eapehnus. 

As regards the bionomics of the Cydoj^odia, Mr. Ui'ich"s obser- 
 vations confirm certain of those of Rodhain and Bequaei-t. He 
 mentions the agility of the movements of the parasites, when 
 disturbed, on the bodies of their hosts â€” a fact which has been 
 noted also concerning other species of Nycteribiidse. These 
 insects are, as stated above, " pupiparous," i. e. the females give 
 birth to full-fed larvse, the integument of which immediatel}' 
 hardens and darkens to form the pnparium. It appears that 
 some species of Nj-cteribiidae attach their laivag to the bodies of 
 their hosts (see Scott, ' Parasitology,' t. c. p. 598), but in 
 Cydopodia greeffi this is not the case. The females of this 
 species attach their larvae to parts of the trees in which the bats 
 have their sleeping-places. Rodhain and Bequaert made their 
 observations on bats in captivity, and the majority of the 
 iSTyctei-ibiid larvae were fixed to the undersides of wooden perches 
 in the cages : these authors think that in a wild state the larvae 
 are probably attached to the smooth trunks or branches of 
 Draccena-tveefi, which are the favourite sleeping-places of the 
 bats near Leopoldville. In San Thome Mr. Urich found the 
 puparia fixed to the upper and lower surfaces of the sm.ooth 
 leaves of certain dicotyledonous trees (name not stated) in which 
 the bats slept. 

Rodhain and Bequaert describe how the female Ci/dopodice 
 with the undersides of their bodies press their larvae down on to 
 the substratum, to which the larva firmly adheres. It imme- 
 diately assumes the shape of, and hardens and darkens to form, 
 the puparium. This is a half-ellipsoidal bod}^, with elliptic 
 contour, rather nai-rower behind, convex dorsally and quite flat 
 ventrally, where it is "glued" to the svibstratum. Its dorsal 
 and ventral siirfaces are separated by an angular margin. The 
 dorsal surface becomes uniformly black, and the resemblance of 
 the puparium to a black scale-insect (such as Saissetia olece) is at 
 first sight very gi'eat, though with closer examination traces of 
 segmentation and the position of the two pairs of larval spiracles 
 are discernible. The puparium is figured by Rodhain and 
 Bequaert, op. cit. p. 258. 

The flat ventral surface of the puparium remains colourless 
 and transparent, and if pupae are detached from their substratum 
 various phases in the development of the enclosed nymph can be
