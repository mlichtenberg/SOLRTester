The present paper is based on the examination of several speci- 
 mens of Ilyrax capensis, both immature and fully adult, which 
 died in the Society's Gardens. Variations were observed in the 
 branches of their vagus and sympathetic nerves ; and the con- 
 ditions present in some of the animals are more complex than 
 those already described in my papers on the Marsupialia (3, 4) 
 and Edentata (5). They are also more complex than those in 
 many animals belonging to other orders. 

Tlie anterior cervical parts of the nerves are placed deeply, and 
 it is necessary to remove the wide ascending rami of the mandible 
 to gain access to them and their branches. 

In all examples the cervical parts of the vagus and sympathetic 
 nerves are fused on both sides to form vago-sympathetic cords, 
 the union taking place at the level of the middle of the thyroid 
 cartilage. The cords are resolved again into their component 
 elements at the root of the neck, but the separation is usually 
 higher on the left side. After they have parted, however, 
 bi'anches of communication may run between them. 

The Vagus Nerves. 

Course : — As it emerges from the foramen lacerum posticum 
 each vagus has the usual relations to the glosso-pharyngeal, spinal 
 accessory and liypoglossal nerves, and it communicates vvith them 
 and the superior cervical ganglion by well-marked branches 
 (text-fig. 6. Cix, Cxi, Cxii and S.O.G). No ganglion nodosum is 
 present in the neck, as in Tamandua tetradactyla (4), or within 
 the foramen lacerum posticum. It then courses postero-mesially, 
 gives off communicating branches to the cervical plexus (C.C.P) 
 and unites with the cervical sympathetic to form the vago- 
 sympathetic cord (V-S) at the level of the middle of the thyroid 
 cartilage. And the nerve up to this point is internal to the 
 mandible. The vago-sympathetic cords break up again in the 
 posterior third of the neck; the vagus half runs still postero- 
 mesially and enters the thorax. Owing to the high level reached 
 by the heart and aorta the first part of the inti'a-thoracic course 
 is short, but the calibre of the left nerve remains thicker than 
 that of the right one. 

IBehind the roots of the lungs the vagi are united by a sinuous 
 cord which is as thick as the left vagus (text-fig, 7, hr), and the 
 nerves emerge again from its extremities, sc the ai-rangement is 
 H-shaped. The left vagus is replaced by right and left branches.
