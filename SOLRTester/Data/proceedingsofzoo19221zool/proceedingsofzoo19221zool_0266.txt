Material. — The material consisted of ten specimens collected 
 by Prof. Leiper from an Indian elephant that died in the London 
 Zoological Society's Gardens. They were the only Helminth 
 parasites found in that elephant. 

Shape ofhody. — These nematodes are just visible to the naked 
 eye. The male is smaller than the female. It is 3'25 mm. 
 long, while the female is 3"8 mm. The maximum diameter is 
 attained near the middle of the body. It is '17 mm. in the 
 male and -18 mm. in the female. The head end is truncated, 
 while the caudal is attenuated to a fine end, more delicate in 
 the female than in the male. The caudal end of the male is 
 crn-ved ventrally. The head end of the body has a lateral 
 cuticular expansion on either side. 

Skin. — The cuticle is striated throughout its length, except for 
 a short distance at the cephalic extremity. The striations are at 
 regular distances of -008 mm. apart. The cuticle is expanded in 
 a membranous fashion on either side of the cephalic end of the 
 body for a di.stance of -6 mm. It is striated in its greater extent, 
 the part corresjjonding in level with the pharynx is not striated. 
 The cuticular expansion is -023 mm. in breadth.
