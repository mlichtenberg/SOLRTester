PARASITES OF ELEPHANTS. 273 

The spicules. — The elongated spicules pursue a wavy course. 
 They are about 2-9 mm. iu length. Their tips are thickened. 
 Tlie accessory piece is short, •12 mm. in length. It is strongly 
 curved from side to side, and less so in the longitudinal direction. 
 The concavity of the latter curvature is directed caudally and 
 dorsally. 

Habitat. The stomach of the African elephant (South Africa. 
 Addo Bush). 

Discussion. 
 The striking difference between the two species of the genus 
 Amira^ is the shape of the bursa. On careful study, however, 
 this difference is minimized by the great similarity between the 
 arrange)nent of all the rays and the pre-bursal papilL-B. The 
 doi'sal rays iu both species have six branches each. Four of these 
 branches are little more than bud-like processes. The remaining 
 two branches are enormously elongated in A. 2nleata and short in 
 A.sameera. This I considered as a specific difference. It is not 
 justifiable to regard it as generic. For this reason I have had 
 to amend Lane's generic diagnosis. The configuration of the 
 mouth, the oesophagus, and spicules are strikingly similar, with 
 differences as regards size only. 

Genus Equinurbia Lane, 1914. 

Fairly large and stout bursate nematodes. There are an 
 external and an internal leaf -crown. The mouth capsule and the 
 oral cavity are more or less globular. The dorsal cesophageal 
 gland discharges through a dorsal gutter. 

Male: There are 11 pairs of rays supporting the male bursa, 
 of which two are ventral, three are lateral, three are externo- 
 dorsal, and three are dorsal. The spicules are equal and similar. 
 There is no accessory piece. 

Female : The vulva opens on the summit of a prominence 
 adjoining the anus. The uteri are convergent and lie parallel to 
 e.ich other, and are furnished with weak ovejectors. 

Type-species, Equinurhia sijyunculiformis. 

Equinurbia sipunculiformis Baird, 1859. 

Sclerostoma sipunctdiforine Baird, 1859. 

Nematode No. 4. Evans & Rennie, 1910. 

Cylicostomimi sipuncuUfoi'im RailL, Henry & Bauche, 1914. 

Uquinurbia sipunculiforme Lane, 1914. 

This species has the chai'acteristics of the genus. Males are 
 15 mm. long and 1-3 maximum diameter. The female is 27*5 mm. 
 long and 1-5 mm, maximum diameter. The spicules are 1*5 mm. 
 long. The tail of the female is 0*8 mm. long. The ova are 60 /j 
 in length and 30-35 /a in breadth. 

Habitat. Ctecum of the Indian elephant (India).
