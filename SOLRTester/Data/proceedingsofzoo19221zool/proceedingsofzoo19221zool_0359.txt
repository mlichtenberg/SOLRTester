 and more heavily bespined^a single spine on the inner side of 
 each femur, two single on the upper side of femur 1 and 2.

 is narrower in proportion to its length. The sternum projects 
 ratl-.er farther between the rear coxte, and the whole specimen 
 is distinctly smaller and more lightly formed.
