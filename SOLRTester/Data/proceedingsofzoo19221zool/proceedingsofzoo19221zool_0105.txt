and are densely covered with minute blunt cones. There is no 
 distinct evidence of a crown. 

The supporting bundle is strongly de- 
 veloped, and iuckides nxnnerous curved 
 spindles of various sizes up to 3-5 mm. 
 in length. 3 or 4 spindles, often about 
 3 mm. long, make the apex of a bundle, 
 and one is stronger than tiie others 
 and projects beyond the polyp for over 
 0-5 mm. The other spindles of the sup- 
 porting bundle are very much smaller. 
 All show a very dense covering of high, 
 blunt cones. 

7. Other spicules. The lower cortex is 
 densely packed with very thick, rough 
 spindles, triradiates, quadiiradiates, irre- 
 gular bodies, and small, almost globular 
 forms, with one particularly strong boss n. hahereri Kiik. 

and numerous jagged points. The com- 
 pound tubercles of all these spicules are well suited for inter- 
 locking. Some of the spindles are irregularly expanded at one 
 end, and might be called club-like in a loose usage of that term.

One specimen shows an undamaged sterile stalk, which has its 
 long diameter in the same plane as the slightly flattened poly- 
 parium. The stl>lk is bright crimson, and shows veiy markedly 
 a multitude of irregular, globular, slightly stellate small spicules 
 which might perhaps be called " astroscleres." 

Some of the anthocodial points show 8-10 rather irregularly 
 converging pairs of rough spindles. There is no definite crown. 
 The degree to which the supporting bundle projects varies con- 
 siderably in different parts of the colony. 

LocALiiy : — Station 282. 

Another colony, marked by a very short sterile stalk, a trans- 
 verse oval mode of growth and little indication of foliate basal 
 branches, shows an interesting colour variation which catches the 
 eye at once. The 8 anthocodial points consist of 7 or more 
 converging pairs of short spindles, but the upper half of each 
 point has bright red spicules, while the lower half and the inter- 
 mediates are white. In most of the polyps this contrast is very 
 pronounced, but in some cases the red spicules predominate, and 
 in other cases there is a slight mixture of the two colours.
