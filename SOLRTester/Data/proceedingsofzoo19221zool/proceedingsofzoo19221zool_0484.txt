walls nntl is armed at the l)ottoui with two lon_e^ spikes, but each 
 of these instead of being simple is divided into a paii- of snbequal 
 branches risinji,- from a common base. There are thus four spikes, 
 a. peculiarity not recorded elsewhere in the Hystricomorpha. 
 (Text-fig. 22, A, B.) 

The prepuce of. Ctenomys is closer to the iinus than in Octodon 
 and the penis itself is thinner, and when viewed from behind or 
 below is seen to be tolerably evenly attenuated to the nan-owed 
 apex, but from the side its distal end is a little expnnded behind 
 the pointed tip. It is beset with spicules, and the pouch is 
 corrugated and armed with a single pair of long spikes, as in 
 Dasyprocta. (Text-fig. 22, D-F.) 

In Dasj/jyrocta the glans of the penis, figured by Tullberg, is 
 subcylindrical, with a bluntly rounded apex, and is beset, espe- 
 cially beneath, with minute recurved sharp papillae ; but on each 
 side of it there is a long lustrous horny blade-like lamina, attached 
 by one edge to the epithelium of the glans, the other edge being- 
 free and finely serrate. This plate is capable of erection, and in 
 this state the free edge stands away from the glans like a ridge. 
 Presumably its function is to fix temporarily the penis in the 
 vagina during copulation. (Text-fig. 23, L.) 

The penis of Coelogenys, described by Owen and others, 
 tolerably closely resembles that of Dasyprocta, except that the 
 horny plate is represented by a short, hard, erectile plate, the free 
 edge of which is armed with about five comparatively large, 
 widely-spaced, thorn-like teeth. In both genera there is a pair 
 of long spikes in the glandular pouch. (Text-fig. 23, I, K.) 

In Cavia porcellus and Galea liUoralis the prepuce is at the 
 lower extremity of the naked subcaudal tract. The glans penis 
 is subcylindrical and apically rounded. On each side of it 
 towards the apex there is a long narrow flap of epithelium, the 
 edge of which is serrulate with soft papillfe, and above this there 
 are a few shorter smaller flaps. The longer larger flap, no doubt, 
 represents the horny lustrous plate on the penis of Dasyprocta, 
 but it is quite soft and pliable, not rigid and horny as in that 
 ;genus. The glandular pouch is deep and provided with a pair 
 of long spikes lying between two strongly developed i-idges on 
 the upper or anterior wall of the pouch. (Text-fig. 23, F-H, M.) 

The penis of Dolichotis projects backwards from the low^er 
 portion of the naked area of skin extending up to the root of the 
 tail. The prepuce is moderately long, but naked. The glans 
 penis is slightly nan-owed apically, its surface is reticulated and 
 pitted, and the genito- urinary orifice, just beneath the tip of the 
 baculum, is lai-ge. The deep, proximally narrowed, glandular 
 pouch is lined with rows of elongated papillae representing the 
 laminate ridges of other genera, but there is a pair of low 
 thickened ridges, corresponding to the large iddges of Cavia and 
 Galea^ passing down the anterior or upper wall. No spikes are 
 present and no trace of the erectile papillate lateral ridge seen in 
 Cavia and Dasyprocta was detected. (Text-fig. 23, A-D.)
