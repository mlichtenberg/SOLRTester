CHARACTERS OF SOME HYSTRICOMORPH RODENTS. 415 

groove extends downwards to the apex of the short, but pro- 
 jecting, haiiy prepuce, just above the tip of which posteriorly 
 may be seen the urinary orifice. (Text-fig. 28, D.) 

In a female Dolichotis there is a single small genito-urinary 
 orifice in the lower half of the naked subcaudal area, and there 
 is no external sign of clitoris or projecting preputial integument. 
 This is the normal condition presented by immature or unpaired 
 female Hystricomorphs. _ Possibly the vulva is closed by mem- 
 brane out of the breeding season. In the present instance 
 its orifice lay, no doubt, beneath the skin between the anus 
 above and the genito-urinary aperture mentioned above. (Text- 
 fig. 28, C.) ^ 

In (Javia po7^ceUus and aperea the vulva is near the centre of 
 the naked glandular anal area and separated from the anus by 
 the depression of the glandular sac. The very short prepuce 
 of the clitoris is situated some distance below the vulva. Before 
 pairing takes place, or out of the breeding season, the vulva 
 is covered with thin membrane, which easily ruptures when 
 stretched. (Text-fig. 28, B.) 

In the female Hydrochcerus, as stated below (p. 419), the vulva 
 is situated a short way beneath the anus, near the lower border 
 of the ano-genital area. It is a large, transversely extended, 
 dilatable orifice, containing and concealing a large, soft, fleshy, 
 linguiform clitoris on its ventral or anterior wall, and the orifice 
 of the urethra is some little distance away from the tip of this 
 clitoris. (Text-fig. 28, A.) 

In Ctenodaotylus the vulva is situated a little below the anus 
 aad the prepuce is elongated and perforated at the top (Text- 
 fig. 28, E.) (See also pp. 419-420.)

The Anus. 
 The anus in Hystrlx and Ath&rura opens in the middle of a 
 naked area, surrounded laterally and above by hairs and spines, 
 and inferiorly reaching to the genital orifice. There is a pair of 
 large, solid, anal glands opening by a slit-like orifice just within 
 the anal aperture, but below the termination of the rectum. The
