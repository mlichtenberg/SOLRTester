canal throughout a considerable region of the body. In the 
 Oligocheeta, on the contrary, this proliferation is restricted, 
 and the pi'oduction of sexual cells is confined, in genera], to one 
 or two testicular segments and a single ovarian segment in the 
 anterior part of the body ; the gonads, moreover, arise from a 
 narrowly circumscribed area on the posterior face of the septa. 
 It is probable that the OligochiBta have originated from some 
 group of Polychfeta ; the evolution of the gonads has therefore 
 been from a non - localized to a more definitely localized 
 condition. 

In Chcetogaster orientalis the gonads (the male, at least) have 
 again lost their localized character; they are no longer definitely 
 circumscribed prolifei'ations of peritoneal cells in a constant 
 position. Tha,t this condition, which is not unlike that of the 
 Polychfeta, i-epresents a regression, and not the persistence of a 
 primitive state, may be taken as certain ; Chcetogaster is the 
 most modified genus of the Naididfe — of the numerous characters 
 in which it difiers from the rest of the fainilj^, not one can be 
 thought of as primitive ; and I believe the Naididee to be 
 themselves far from primitive among the Oligochpeta. 

We may for the sake of clearness express the facts in a 
 somewhat diflferent way. In certain animals the first visible 
 dift'erentiation in development is that of the germ-cells ; in 
 Ascaris, for example, as is well known, the peculiarities of theii- 
 chromatin constitution enable them to be distinguished from the 
 first. And it is possible that a similar "germ-track" exists in 
 all animals, but that we are imable, with our present means of 
 investigation, to distinguish it in all — at least in its earlier 
 stages. It is possible, in other wox-ds, that in all animals the 
 germinal material (germ-plasm) is set apart from the first in 
 certain cells and their descendants, and that in the shaping of 
 the organism these find their way, sometimes by fairly extensive 
 wanderings, to their station in the gonads, or rather to their 
 particular station in the coelomic lining membrane (in the 
 Triploblastica) where, by their proliferation, they give rise to 
 the gonads. In the Polycheeta their distribution is wide ; in 
 the Oligochfeta extremely circumscribed ; in Chcetogaster orien- 
 talis it has again become wide. 

With what peculiarity of structure or habit, or Avith what 
 feature of the past history of Chcetogccster can this change be 
 correlated ? I can think of only one that is at all likely, and 
 even here I do not think it is easy to suggest how the change 
 has been brought about. 

I have previously suggested (5) that Chcetogaster is descended 
 from parasitic ancestors. I do not wish to repeat the argument 
 at length ; I will only say that Chcetogaster, alone of the Naidida?, 
 never shows the phenomenon of an ascending current of water 
 beginning at the anus and impelled up the intestine by anti- 
 peristalsis and ascending ciliary action ; and that the loss of cilia 
 and of the ciliary function of the intestine is presumably due
