(5) The Relationship of Moniligaster to Drawida. 

The genera Drcmida and Monilirjaster differ only in the fact 
 that Moniligaster has, and Drawida ha,s not, connected with the 
 ectal end of the spermathecal duct, a bilobed glandular appendage, 
 of which each lobe consists of a number of closely-packed branches. 
 In Drawida there may be a swelling on the end of the duct, or at 
 most a relatively small sac-like atrial diverticulum. 

Michaelsen (13) takes Drannda for the ancestor, Moniligaster 
 for the descendant ; he traces the history of the at first simple 
 duct in Drawida. In some species it " widens and is transformed 
 into a muscular coat. In other species of this genus this widened 
 muscular distal {i. e., ectal) end grows into a real muscular atrial 
 chamber, which further on enlarges at one side to form a 
 separate blind sac, depending into the second segment, or, m the 
 species D. robiosia and its subspecies, at two sides, forming two 
 outt^rowths, one depending into the seventh segment, the other 
 into the eighth, the two outgrowths being separated by the 
 septum 7/8,''- and the duct of the pouch entering the atrial 
 chamber at the angle between these two outgrowths. The 
 structure found in the species of Moniligaster may be compared 
 with this structure in D. rohusta. The two outgrowths of the 
 atrial cavity in the latter species are continued m Mondigaster 
 each into a large gland, consisting of a large, much-branched 
 tube, the branches and twigs of which are packed together and 
 enveloped in a peritoneal membrane." ^ .. ^ , 

This derivation does not seem easy to me ; I should preter to 
 read the series (if indeed it is a series) in the reverse direction. 
 I cannot see in Moniligaster any atrial chamber at all— only two 
 olands, with ducts which unite, like the limbs of a Y, to form a 
 single canal. This is well shown in Perrier's original plate (18) ; 
 my' own description of the condition in Perrier's species is 
 similar (22):— "The stalk (atrium) is relatively narrow, and 
 bifurcates, one branch going to each half of the mass. Neither 
 ■ the stalk' nor its two branches are in any sense sacs ; the 
 appearance is that of two ducts proceeding one from each halt ot 
 the mamillated glandular mass, which unite to form a common 
 duct; this common duct is less than half as long as the glandular 
 part and nowhere dilated." It seems difficult to imagine a 
 slight swelling of the end of the duct dilating, becoming a sac- 
 bifurcating, and then sprouting glands from each horn, itselt 
 concomitantly narrowing to a Y-shaped duct. If- the series 
 really is a natural one, it would be easier to read it the other way— 
 as a o-vadual reduction, of the glands to a non-functional vestige 
 and their final disappearance. It is possible that the glands are 
 entirely independent of the spermathecfe in origin ; compare
