DR. M. KHALIL ON THE NEMATODE 

Discussion. 

The main specific diffei'enees between the members of the genus 
 JIurshidia are to be found in the shape of the I'ays of the male 
 buiv^a, the length of the spicules, the length of the female tail, and 
 the distance between the vagina and the anus. These and other 
 differences are for convenience tabulated below. 

Upon these data the specie.s Miirshidla liiistovn was differen- 
 tiated. 

Railliet, Henry and Bauche have recorded the presence of 
 Murshidia falcifera in the African elephant. This was probably 
 eith".r M. had.ia or Ihistowi, which bear a superficial resemblance 
 to M. falcifera. 

In the follow^ing table all measurements given are in millimetres. 
 The measurements of M. marshida and M. falcifera are based 
 partly on Lane's record and partly on material of both species 
 sent by him to Prof. Leiper. These specimens ai'e labelled by 
 Lane as type material of the respective species. The measure- 
 ments of M. linstowi are based on the oi'iginal record of this 
 species by von Linstow. Where the sex is not stated, the 
 measurements ai-e put in the centre of the column.
