CHARACTERS OF SOME HYSTRICOMORPH RODENTS. 369 

Dolichotis*, for example, in which there is a parting in the hairs 
 in the middle line of the upper lip which, especially in dried 
 skins, sometimes simulates a small philtrum ; but, although this 
 may be the remains of a true philtrum, it is very different from 
 that structure in HysUnx and Thrynomys. 

The rhinaria of Goendit and Erethizon differ greatly from 
 that of Hystrix. In Goenclu it is haiiy and the nostrils are 
 quite small and vertical rather than ti-ansverse in direction, the 
 postero-lateral slit being absent. In Erethizon the rhinarium is 
 marked by shorter hairs than that of the area round it. The 
 nostrils are larger and more transverse than in Coenchc and are 
 very close together, the space between them and their very 
 narrow upper edge being smooth. In neither genus is there a 
 philtrum. (Text-fig. 2, D, E.) 

In Capromys the rhinarium is large and naked, but not very 
 well defined laterally, where it passes into the short-haired area, 
 surrounding it above as well as laterally and below. It is marked 
 by a median groove in front. The nostrils are elongated and 
 expanded anteriorly. (Text-fig. 2, A, B.) In Myocastor the 
 I'hinarium is wider as compared with its depth than in 
 Capromys, the areas above and below the nostrils being much 
 narrower ; there is no median groove, and the nostrils them- 
 selves are much smaller, forming crescentrically valvular slits. 
 (Text-fig. 3, A.) 

In Gtenomys, Octodon, and Cavia the rhinarium forms a naked 
 area round the nostrils, the areas above and below these orifices 
 being narrow. (Text-fig. 4, C.) In Octodon it is mesially grooved 
 and angled below. In Ctenomys it has the upper edge biconvex 
 and mesially angled, the inferior edge transverse in the middle. 
 (Text-fig. 4, A, B.) In Cavia the nostrils are wider than in the 
 two Octodonts above described, the upper edge of the rhinarium 
 is concave, the lower convex from side to side, and there is 
 sometimes hair between the nostrils. (Text-fig. 4, F.) 

In Dolichotis patagonica the entire nose is large, with a wide 
 rhinarium concave in the middle and convex at the side above 
 and below, the finely hairy and tolerably deep areas bordering 
 the large transversely extended nostrils above and below being 
 thickened and muscular. In one example of this species the 
 internarial area was hairy in the middle line, whereas in an 
 example of D. salinicola it was naked ; but this character is 
 possibly not constant. (Text-fig. 3, D.) 

In Godogenys the upper rim of the nostril is swollen and 
 muscular, but the rhinarium itself is scarcely defined, being 
 covered with very fine short hairs, leaving only a narrow hairless 
 area above and below the elongated narrow nostrils. Judging 
 from dried skins the rhinarium of Dasyprocta is very similar. 
 (Text-fig. 3, B.) 

* I am not sure about tlie structure of tlie upper lip in Dasyprocta. The only 
 spirit example available had the rhinarium destroyed ; hut dried skins suggest the 
 absence of a complete philtrum. In living examples there appears to be a median 
 groove formed by a vertical fold in the skin of the upper lip.
