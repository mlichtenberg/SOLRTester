'Termination of the female. — The female tail is 2-3 mm. long. It

 the externo-dorsal ray was completely missing on one side, as 
 is shown in the accompanying camera-lucida drawii^g. This 
 abnormality must be ver}'- rare, and has apparently not been 
 recorded before. 

Discussion. 

As was mentioned before, the identification of any particular 
 species of the genus Quilonia from descriptions only is very 
 difficult. Diagrams representing the head and tail ends are 
 necessary. Q. hrevicauda is easily distinguished on account of 
 its short stumpy tail. For the rest, careful comparison is neces- 
 sary for diagnosis. The important features in this connection 
 are the shape of the head, the external leaf-crown, the dorsal 
 ray of the male bursa, the length of the spicules, the length of 
 female tail, and the distance between the vulva and anus. 

The fact that the external leaf -crown may or may not project 
 above the head divides the genus into two groups. In Q. renniei,
