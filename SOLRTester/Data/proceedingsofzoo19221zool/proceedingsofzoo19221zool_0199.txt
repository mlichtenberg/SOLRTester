SYMPATHETIC NERVES OF HYRAX CAPENSIS. 153 

the lesser curvature, and the latter supplies the fundus. Both 
 groups anastomose with branches from the right vagus, and with 
 the cceliac plexus. The cord formed by the right vagus and part 
 of the left one supplies the dorsal aspect of the stomach almost to 
 the pylorus. Its branches anastomose with those of the left 
 vagus, and twigs from the coeliac plexus. A well-marked branch 
 (splanchnic ?) runs to the left sympathetic cord (A). Many of 
 the oesophageal nerves run postei'iorly and anastomose with both 
 vagi, so there is a close network round the lower end of the 
 oesophagus and over the left part of the stomach. 

The Sympathetic Nerves. 

The Superior Cervical Ganglion (text-fig. 6, s.c.g) is round or 
 oval, and flat. It gives ofi' an internal carotid nerve of con- 
 siderable length (i.c.n) which accompanies the internal carotid 
 artery into the skull. The nerve communicates with the glosso- 
 pharyngeal and hypoglossal nerves, and the ganglion is connected 
 to the vagus, cervical plexus, and loop between the superior and 
 recurrent laryngeal nerves. But no connection exists between 
 either and the spinal accessory nerve. From the posterior pole 
 of the ganglion the sympathetic cord runs laterally and joins the 
 vagus at the level of the middle of the th^^-oid cartilage to form 
 the vago-sympathetic cord. 

In Hyrax, as in all animals possessing the vago-sympathetic 
 cord, no middle cervical ganglion is present, and no direct rami 
 communicantes run to the middle cervical nerves. 

The sympa,thetic separates again in the posterior part of the 
 neck, but communicates with the vagus after the partition. It 
 exhibits a well-marked inferior cervical ganglion (I.C.G) on the 
 left side, but none on the right. From the ganglion branches of 
 communication run to the brachial plexus, but I was unable to 
 detect any communication between the right sympathetic and 
 brachial nerves, or between either cord and phrenic nerves. The 
 right sympathetic gives off a branch which accompanies the 
 vertebral artery (V.A.N), and a loop connects it to the right 
 recurrent nerve. And as no branch runs directly to the cardiac 
 plexus, the right recurrent and right vagus nerves conduct all 
 the right sympathetic filaments to the heart. 

The left inferior cervical ganglion gives off a medium-sized 
 cardiac branch (c.B.s) which runs almost parallel to the left 
 recurrent nerve, passes to the dorsal aspect of the aortic arch and 
 ends in the deep cardiac plexus. 

The Avmdus of Vieussens (A.Y) is present only on the left 
 side, and the right sympathetic cord passes in front of the right 
 subclavian artery. 

The left sympatJietic thoracic cord (text-fig. 8, L.s) has few 
 ganglia in its anterior part, and it forms loops. At the level of 
 the middle of the root of the left lung it divides into lateral and 
 mesial divisions. The former possesses a loop and a small ganglion,
