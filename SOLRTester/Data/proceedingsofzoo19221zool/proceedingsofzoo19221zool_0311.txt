PARASITES OF ELEPHANTS, 255 

Their cephalic ends are thick and surrounded by an everted lip. 
 In their course they apparently entwine each other. Their tips 
 are sharp and curved backwards. The accessory piece is -13 mm, 
 long and curved dorso-ventrallj'. 

Termination of the female. — At the level of the vulva the 
 ventral surface curves towards the dorsum, forming a conical- 
 shaped tail. The opening of the vulva is directed caudally. The 
 anus opens -12 mm. posterior to the vulva, and is also directed 
 caudally. The tail is -52 mm. in length ; its end is rounded. 
 There are two caudal papillae marked on the surface by a depres- 
 sion 'SS mm. from the extremity of the tail. 

Ova. — The ova in the terminal portion of the uterus measure 
 48 /.t by 30 fj. They are then in the morula stage. 

Hahilat. Intestine of African elephant (Uganda). 

Dlsciissioti. 

This species differs from P. africana in the shape of the mouth 
 capsule, which is more elongated ; the absence of the plumose 
 appearance of the oesophagus ; the greater distance between the 
 vulva and anus ; and the general appearance of the tail in the 
 female. In the male the spicules are shorter, and the bifid end 
 of the branch of the dorsal ray is also much longer. The total 
 length of the body and of the various structures are also different. 

As the plumose corrugation of the oesophagus for which Lane 
 suggested the generic name Pteridoph.arynx is absent, this can 
 only be considered a specific chni'ucter. J'ho same plumose 
 appearance is present in Memphisia aziza, which undoubtedly 
 belongs to a different genus on' account of the configuration of 
 the head and the presence of an additional ray in the bursa, both 
 of which are important morphological characteristics. 

Genus Memphisia Klialil, 1922. 

Body is slender. The rays of the external leaf-crown do not 
 project freely above the head. The oral cavity is deep, and 
 is wider from side to side than from before backwards. There 
 are chitinous teeth in the floor of the mouth capsule. A shallow 
 oesophageal funnel is pi-esent. The oesophagus is short and thick. 
 Plumose appearance of the cephalic end of the lumen of the 
 oesophagus may or may not be present. 

Just caudad to the mouth collar the cuticle is raised to form 
 a collar surrounding the circumference of the body. The degree 
 of projection of this cuticular collar varies in the two species. 

Male. The lateral ray has an accessory ray on its posterior 
 border. The externo-dorsal ray has a branch directed caudally. 
 Of the three branches of the dorsal ray the outer two are fused 
 to nearly their tips. Their dual nature is indicated by ending in 
 two papillfe. The two spicules are equal and similar. An 
 accessory piece is present.
