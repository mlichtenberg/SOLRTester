During- the latter pai't of tlie last centur}- a good deal of work 
 was done upon the respiiution of the amphihioiis gastropod 
 Ampullaria. The studies of Bavay, Sahatier, Bouvier and Fischer 
 together with the more recent work of Ramanan yielded a 
 satisfactory general account of the process. The method by 
 which the gill and lung are alternatively employed, the con- 
 ditions under which one or the other becomes functional and 
 the relation of the circulation to the I'espiratory orgaris are there- 
 fore fairly well known. There are, however, several details upon 
 which the older accounts are vague, and certain features seemed 
 so inexplicable that the donation by Colonel Knight and Colonel 
 Porteous of living examples of A. vermiforinis to the Society, 
 ■afforded a very welcome opportunity for fresh study. 

The general phenomena of pulmonary and bi^anchial respiration 
 recorded by Jourdain (6), Bouvier and Fischer (3), and Bavay (1) 
 for various Neotropical forms are found to take place in A. vermi- 
 formis. There is no need, therefore, to describe the details Avhich 
 may be found in the tuo latter papers. Bavay described three 
 types of respiration, and I propose to use the term ' siphonal ' for 
 the one in which air is drawn into the lung through the siphon 
 while the animal is still under water. It is to be distinguished 
 from ordinary branchial respiration on the one hand and from 
 direct pulmonary respiration on the other. 

A. The first point upon which fresh evidence may be offered 
 is the function of the longitudinal ridge ( ' repli palleal' ) Avhich 
 sub-divides the pallial cavity. Jourdain, Bavay and others speak 
 •as though the pallial cavity were divided into two separate parts 
 by the ridge in question which runs up the floor of the cavity 
 parallel to and on the left-hand side of the gill and rectum. The 
 precise role of such a division is not specified by previous workers ; 
 but one is left with the distinct impression that this apparent 
 division of the mantle-cavity into right (branchial) and left 
 (pulmonary) areas is of impovtaiice in respiration. The available 
 facts, however, appear to indicate that this is not the case. To 
 seal effectually the 'pulmonary' pallial chamber from water or the 
 branchial chamber from air, the separation of the two chambers 
 should be complete. But in over twent}^ examples of various 
 species and genera I have never found the ridge nearly high 
 enough along its entii'e length to touch the pallial roof. Bavay,
