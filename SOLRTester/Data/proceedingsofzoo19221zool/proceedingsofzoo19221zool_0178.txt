and stain a light pink ; the nuclei, 3-4 ^ in diameter, do not stain 
 deeply ; the cell contents are uniformly granular. Cell outlines 
 are present; the cells in the depth of the organ appear polygonal 
 in section, Avhile those nearer the mouth are elongated in the 
 clii-ection of the neck, and at the mouth these are continuous 
 with the surface epithelium. It may be that all the cells of the 
 interior reach the surface. 

The figure of one of these organs shows a remarkable similarity 
 to a simple type of spermatheca ; and it does not seem impossible 
 that spermatheca? may have arisen from such structures. 

(8) liudimentary {i.e., Incijyient) Gizzards. 

Invisible in dissection, but revealed in the microscopic examina- 
 tion of sections, is an incipient gizzard belonging to segm. xi 
 (fig. 4, rud.), and, more rudimentary still, one in x. IS^otable is 
 the thickening of the connective- tissue layer in the incipient 
 gizzards, outside the layer of the strengthened circular muscular 
 fibres.
