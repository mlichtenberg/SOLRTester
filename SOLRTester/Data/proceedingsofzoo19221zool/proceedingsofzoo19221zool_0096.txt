well suited for interlocking. They include the following foi'ms : — 
 (a) long stout spindles, slightly curved ; (h) spindles expanding at 
 one end in a pseudo-club fashion ; (c) a few large triradiates ; 
 (d) numerous irregular triradiates ; (e) smaller triradiates with a 
 rovigh boss rising at right angles to the rays ; (f) long-armed 
 quadriradiates ; {g) knobbed spherical " astroscleres." 

The spicules of the cortex in general are spindles densely 
 covered with relatively larger, rough-tipped, rounded tubercles. 
 Especially on the shorter spindles do these tubercles stand out to 
 a notable height like mammillaj, projecting to about one-fifth of 
 the brea.dth of the spindle. 

On the branches and twigs all the spicules are deep red, and 
 there are numerous lai-ge spindles which tend to project on the 
 surface in jagged fashion, being on the whole transversely 
 disposed. 

No spicules were to be found in the canal-walls. 

The following measurements were taken : — 

(a) Supporting-bundle spicules ; . . . Up to 2 mm. 

(b) General upper-cortex spicules Up to 4 mm. 

(c) Largest spindles of the cortex of the 

sterile stalk Up to 2 mm. 

Locality: — Station 91. Macaras Reef in 27 fathoms. 

10. Dendronephthya klunzingeri (Stud,). 

Described by Studer in Ann, & Mag. Nat, Hist. (6) vol. i. p. 72. 

Diagnosis: — Divaricate; contour discontinuous ; polyps 10-12 
 in each bundle, which resembles a close corymb ; polyp stalks 
 very short : supporting bundle strong ; point spicules 8-10 close 
 together, none projecting ; no crown ; grade II. ; spicules : in 
 the stem loosely disposed slender spindles minutely spinulose, in 
 the cortex of the sterile stalk spindles are more thorny and 
 include triradiates and quadrii^adiates ; colour : white on the 
 whole, but with red-yellow twigs and polyp stalks. 

Anthocodial Grade and Formula : — 

II. = 8-10 p + Cr -^ strong S.B, 
 Descriptive Notes : — 

1. Colony as a loliole. Markedly divaricate; contour dis- 
 continuous. A single, young colony. 

2. Branching. Branches of vai'ied lengths and growing in one 
 plane. The colony therefore ought to be referred to Kiikenthal's 
 " B '" section of the group Divaricatse, and certainly in the 
 neigh bo u.rhood of D. klunzingeri. 

3. Colouring. Predominantly reddish yellow in the twigs and 
 polyp stalks, elsewhere whitish. 

4. Polyp stalks very short. 

5. Polyps. Each bundle of polyps is rather like a close corymb 
 and contains 10-12 heads. The tentacles are soft.
