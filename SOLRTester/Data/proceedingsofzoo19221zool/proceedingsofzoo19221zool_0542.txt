The terminal third of each spicule is wound round its fellow, 
 and its tip is slightly bent. Each spicule is provided with a thin 
 chitinousaud finely transvei'seJy striated flange ; this flange starts 
 near the hase of the spicule and accompanies it almost to its tip. It 
 becomes broader posteriorly, having its maximum breadth — about 
 15 /i — at its termination, which is about 50^ from the tip of the 
 spicule. A guhernamlum (text-fig 5 5) is present; this in side 
 view is boomerang-shaped, with the posterior end terminating in 
 a sharp point. Along its outer curve it is 170^* long, and its 
 maximum depth (at the bend) is 17 /x.

 the lateral bursal lobe. 

The posterior end of the female (text-fig. 6 a) tapers abruptly, 
 so that the tail is relatively short, measuring 114-142 m or about 
 rfs "^f ^^^^ total length. ISTear its tip there is situated on either 
 side a small caudal papilla. 

The vaginal cipertm-e (text-fig. 6 a) is circular, and is situated 
 a short distance— 245 /^— in front of the anus. The cuticle 
 bordering its posterior margin is slightly protruded. The vagina 
 is roughly sigmoid in shape and is about 240 /t long. Its lumen
