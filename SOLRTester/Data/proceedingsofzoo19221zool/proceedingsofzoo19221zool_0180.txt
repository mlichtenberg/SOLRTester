containing the organs of both sides, or a pair in each segment, 
 one for the organs of the i-ight and one for those of the left side. 
 Thus in the common European genus Lumhricus there is a single 
 testis sac (often called the median seminal vesicle) in each of the 
 testis segments ; while in many species of the common Indian 
 genera, Pheretima and Eutyjyhmus, the sacs are paired (text- 
 tig. 8). 

In the genus Ocnerodrilus, and in a few species of Enchytrceus, 
 testis sacs of a different type are found. The sacs enclose the 
 testis, and are a,ttached like the latter to the anterior septum of 
 the segment, projecting freely into its cavit}- ; the funnels, 
 however, are outside the sac, and, as usual, on the posterior 
 septum of the segment ; it is evident that the sac must rupture 
 before the spermatozoa can enter the funnel. In this case the 
 sac can hardly be anything else than the superficial layer of the 
 proliferating peritoneal cells which give rise to the gonad ; this 
 layer separates off as a connected membrane, beneath which the 
 genital cells are shed and ripen (text-fig. 9) *. The lobes of the

testes of some species of Luinhricillus are also (at any rate in 
 their young state) surrounded by a thin membrane, within 
 which the genital cells are cast off and undergo some of tlieir 
 development. 

Lastly, in all the Moniligastridae the testis sacs are paired 
 vesicles, suspended by the septa in such a way that they project 
 into the segment in front or into the segment behind, or (more 
 xisually) into both; the degree of projection forwaids or 
 backwards varies in different individuals of the same species, 
 and sometimes on the two sides of the same individual. Within 
 each sac — usually perhaps on its floor towards the anterior wall — 
 is the testis, a proliferation of the epithelial lining of the sac ; 
 the funnel is also included in the sac, and is situated on the

 had taken np their position beneath it.
