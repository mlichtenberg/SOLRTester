equidistant (text-fig. 3). The cliitinous lining of the funnel is 
 provided with three flange-like cliitinous plates, projecting into 
 the lumen in a longitudinal dii'ection ; each flange is situated 
 about half-way between each pair of tooth-like processes. 

The funnel passes into the oesophageal lumen, which, from its 
 commencement, is triradiate in transverse section, the sides of 
 each ray being strongly cliitinized. The (esophagus (text-fig. 1) 
 is a little less than -^^^ of the total length of the worm ; it is slightly 
 swollen nuteriorly round the funnel; posteriorly it becomes 
 gradually thickened, and assumes the form of a club, its greatest 
 diameter being 11 U ^i. 

The intestine which folloAVS has a dark colour ; it passes 
 straiglit backwards to open to the extei'ior by a short rectum 
 lined internally witli chitin.

The nerve ring is situated just behind the level of the cervical 
 groove, its dorsal part being slightly more anterior than its 
 ventral. 

In the cervical groove, on the ventral sui'face, is situated the 
 opening of the excretory duct ; this duct passes obliquely back- 
 wards and inwards, and in so doing passes over the ventral 
 surface of the nerve ring. 

The male genital hursa is ample, forming about Jg- part of the 
 length of the worm and being nearly twice as broad as it is deep 
 (text-fig. 4). It consists of two lateral lobes united by a small 
 median doi'sal lobe. In each lateiul lobe are situated six lays. The 
 two ventral rays are of the same size, I'un parallel, and are closely
