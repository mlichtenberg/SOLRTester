aiifl it is inserted into the vertebral border and margin of the 
 deep surface of the scapula. It is impossible to separate it into 
 major and minor rhomboids. The sheet does not extend to the 
 occiput as it does in many Piimates. 

The serratus magnus arises from the first ten ribs and inter- 
 spaces, but the origin forms a uniform muscular line instead of 
 pointed slips as in Man. Its insertion into the A'ertebral border 
 of the scapula is thick and muscular. 

The omo-trachelian is a powerful mnscle attached to the supra- 
 spinous fossa and root of the spine of the scapula. 

The dorso-ejntrochlearis (text-fig. 11, J) is a very strong muscle. 
 It is 4| inches long and 1| broad. Proximally it is intimately 
 connected to the latissimus dorsi and teres major. Its rounded 
 distal border is bound by a strong tendon to the internal condyle 
 of the humerus and the olecranon. It is supplied by a branch of 
 the musculo-spiral nerve (text-fig. 23, D.E.M).

The deltoid (text-fig. 10, D.M) is very powerful, and its super- 
 ficial fibres are fused with those of the pectoralis major. It has 
 an extensive origin from the whole of the ventral surface of the 
 clavicle except the sternal end, the acromion, and outer two-thirds 
 of the spine of the scapula. And the fibres arising from the 
 acromion are tendinous. All converge to the usual deltoid 
 insertion. 

The teres major (text-fig. 11,1) has the same origin and insertion 
 as in Man, bnt it is intimately blended with the latissimus dorsi 
 and dorso-epitrochlearis. The teres mhwr has also an origin 
 similar to that in Man, but its tendon of insertion is pushed on tc 
 the humerus distal to the greater tuberosit}\
