observed tln-ough this ventral transparent covering. In the 
 material sent by Mr. Urich several stji.ges can be seen, including 
 a. fully-formed adult nearly ready to emerge from the puparium. 
 Sufficient has now been written to introduce Mr. Urich's own 
 report of his observations. 

II. Observations in San Thome in 1920 : by F. W. Urich. 

The host of the Cyclopodia was the flying-fox Eidolon helvum 
 Kerr (= Cynonycteris straniinea Geofii-.), which was common 
 and numerous in the north-western part of the island of San 
 Thome. These flying-foxes seem to have established themselves 
 in the woods situated near Morro Moguingui (about 3 miles from 
 the sea) — at least, that is where they passed the day. Every 
 evening, as soon as the last rays of the sun disappeared, they 
 sallied out in thousands. They all flew towards the interior, 
 those going far kept very high and the others whose objective 
 was near by just kept above the tree-tops ; in the morning just 
 befoi'e sunrise, between 5 and 6, they could be seen returning to 
 their sleeping quarters. Their food consisted princijmlly of the 
 ripe fruit of the papaya, Carica papaya, which grew Avild all 
 over the island. At the island of Principe, where the same 
 species of flying-fox occurs, I was told that they attacked cacao 
 pods, papaya not being so common there. The trees selected for 
 sleeping were very tall and slender-stemmed, and the flying-foxes 
 were settled so close together that two shots from a fowling-piece 
 brought down 20 specimens. This roosting-place was known to 
 be used for years, and the small branches of the trees showed 
 very old scars and scratches from the flying-foxes' claws ; the 
 ground under the trees was covered with young j)apaya seedlings, 
 and a peculiar acrid odour from accumulated excrement prevailed 
 under the trees *. The dead specimens were put into cloth bngs 
 as quickly as possible to prevent the escape of ;iny Nycteribiid ; 
 the parasites moved about quickly on the bodies of their hosts, 
 but I did not observe an}^ actually darting about. The leaves of 
 the trees used for roosting were dotted with numerous puparia. 
 A hundred leaves collected at j'andom showed 61 pnparia on the 
 top surface and 96 underneath. The leaves were smooth on both 
 surfaces. The skin of the larva must dry and harden very 
 quickly ; dead specimens were placed in cloth bags at about 
 2 p.m., and four hoiu's after two fully hardened und coloured 
 puparia were found sticking to the cloth. [Rodhain and Bequaert, 
 op. cit. p. 257, state that the hardening and darkening process is 
 complete in 20-30 minutes after the birth of the larva.] 

* [Habits not unlike tliose here described have been noted among various kinds of 
 large fruit-eating bats by other observers. IS. g., in the Seychelles the local tlying- 
 foxes [Fteropus^-p.) have regular sleeping-places in particular clumps of trees, and 
 "Camp Chauve-Souris " has become a place-name in at least one island (Silhouette). 
 In Mahe (1908) the bats might frequently be seen in numbers passing northwards 
 along the west coast of the island at sunset, on their way (it was said) from one of 
 their "camps" to tlieir feeding-grounds, wliich were said to be places where bread- 
 fruit and other fruit trees were plentiful. — H. Scott.]
