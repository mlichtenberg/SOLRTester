We may suppose that the mating of the F„'s may be represented 
 thus : — 

Group A XYXYS x XYXY8. 

Group B XYYxS X XYyXS. 

Group A, gametes... XYS f XY x XYS + XY. 

F3 XYXYSS + XYXYS + XYXY8+XYXY^ 

The first should be pure white dominants, the next two typical 
 piles, and the last recessive black-red, the suppressing factor 
 being absent. 

Group B, gametes. . . XYS + xYS + XY + xY x XYS + XyS + 

XY + Xy. 
 F„ XXYYSS, XXYySS, xX YYSS, xXy Y^SS. 

2XXYYS, 2XXYyS, 2XxY^YS, 2xXyYS. 

XYXY, xYXY, XYXy, xXyY. 

Thus there would be four combinations of Xx and Yy. namely 

XXY^Y, XXYy, XxYY, and xXy Y ; 

and these would be combined with SS, S, or absence of S. There 
 would be, therefore, in 16 individuals four coloured recessives of 
 varying composition, four pure dominants, and eight heterozygotes 
 or piles. This agrees fairly well with my results, if we assume 
 that the different combinations of the colour components affect 
 the degree of visible colour. 

It is evident, however, that the combinations which are 
 recessive for S ought to show no more white than did the 
 original Black red, whereas in my specimens the three lecessive 
 hens show distinct evidence of white : this is more in accordance 
 with the assumption of imperfect segregation. 

In the second cross the hens with most white and least colour 
 were mated with anothei- black-red. If we suppose that the 
 white hens had more of the colour factors than the original 
 Whites and were of constitution XYXYSS, then the cross would 
 be 

XYXYSS X XYXY. 

Gametes XYS and XY. 

Progeny XYXYS. 

Thus all the piles in this case will be homozygous for the 
 combination XY, whereas in the first cross many of the piles were 
 heterozygotes for this combination. 

Lastly we may consider the possible genetic combinations in 
 the fancier's pi-ocess of crossing pile with black-red to improve the 
 colour of the former. The cross might be 

XYXYS X XYXY. 

Gametes XYS + XY x XY, 

Progeny XYXYS + XYXY.
