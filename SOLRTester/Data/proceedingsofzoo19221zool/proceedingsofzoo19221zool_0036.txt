Grant's gazelle, and hartebeest. The liealtli of tlie host appeal's- 
 to be unimpaired. 

Taking it all ronnd disease is rare among game and serious epi- 
 demics are uncommon ; as Mr. Percival has pointed out, the reason 
 is that directly an animal becomes sick it either leaves the herd 
 or is driven out, and being alone and dull -with sickness it more 
 readily falls a prey to one of the killers or one of the scavengers ; 
 next day the vultures complete the stoiy, and veiy little is left to 
 form a breeding gTound for the flies which are the great dis- 
 seminatoi's of disease. 

It would take far too long to attempt to deal with each species 
 of the various game animals in the part of Africa with whicli I 
 am acquainted, and so much has already been written by others. 
 I will, however, venture to refer to one or two of particular 
 interest. 

Elephant. â€” First comes the elephant. The numbers of 
 elephant have greatly decreased during the last thirt}'' years, for 
 apart from the European sportsmen from overseas, the residents 
 in the country have accounted for a large number ; further, the 
 improvement in communications has indii-ectly led to a greater- 
 amount of illicit slaughter. It is true that game laws have been 
 in force in British East Africa and. Uganda for about twenty years- 
 and administered by a keen staft", and the ports have been cai'e- 
 f ully watched ; but a great deal of ivory has nevertheless been- 
 smuggled out over our land frontiers both to the north and south,, 
 and without heavy expenditure this was impossible to check. 
 There are certain small tribes like the Dorobo and Sania who are 
 professional hunters, and many of the Eastern Akamba are gi'eat 
 oSenders. A native with a few tusks has up to now had no great 
 difficulty in disposing of them to some itinerant Arab, Baluchi, 
 or 8omali trader who was wandering about ostensibly trading in 
 hides, and Indian traders could always be found to finance such- 
 undertakings. 

The elephant endangers itself by consei-vatism, for it is m 
 beast of very regular habits ; at certain seasoiis it invariablv 
 seeks certain localities, and it is interesting to map out the lines 
 of migration. 

Generally speaking, in the hot dry season it seeks the shelter- 
 of the high forests, and in the rains treks to more open country ; 
 native hunters say that the peipetual drip from the trees in tlie 
 forest is distasteful to it. Elephants in the Kilimanjaro region, 
 for instance, move down the northern flanks of the Usambara 
 Range about April and spread out through the ISTyika Plains 
 almost to the coast, one of the attractions there being the ripe 
 fruit of great groves of Hyphfene palms. 

Similarly, another herd migrates each year from the same 
 region and marches east, crossing the Uganda Hail way near- 
 Kinani and on eastward across the Athi into Southern Ivitui. 

For many years past, about J une, a herd of elephants has come-
