Historical Jievietv. â€” This species was independently described 
 by Railliet and his co-workers on the one hand, and by Lane on 
 the other. The descriptions in some respects are complementary. 
 Lane definitely mentions that an accessory piece is absent. 
 Railliet and his colleagues do not mention it at all. Thei^e is 
 important discrepancy in tlie bursal rays as described and drawn. 
 Lane records the presence of a long pre-bursal papilla assuming 
 the appeai'ance of a ray and lying close in front of the double 
 ventral ray. This is completely missed by the other observers. 
 On the other hand, Railliet figures two small branches to the 
 dorsal ray, while Lane records one only. The head end is well

represented in the diagram of Railliet. It is thought advisable 
 to re-describe the bursa. 

The Bursa is greatly elongated. This is due mainly to the 
 length of the dorsal lobe. The bursa is TO mm. in length 
 and 0-55 mm. in breadth. The cuticle in front of the bursa on 
 the ventral surface is very much thickened. The free edges of 
 the lateral lobes of the bursa are folded inwards, obscuring the 
 exact mode of ending of the lateral rays. 

The pre-bursal papilla is vei^y long and thin. It pursues a 
 wavy course, and ends close to the termination of the ventral 
 i-ay. It is 0*25 mm. in length.
