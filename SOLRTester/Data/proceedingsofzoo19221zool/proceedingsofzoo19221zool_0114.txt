ouce that it is almost precisely that of D. piltteri (Divaricate) 
 and not far from D. lutea (Umbellate, but with interrupted 
 contour). The length of the point spicules is about 0-75 mm., 
 but one is often slightly smaller than the other. Between the 
 points there lies a pair of much smaller intermediates. At the 
 base of the points there is a crown of about 3 roAvs of curved 
 spindles, but some of these are often displaced so as to appear 
 like the lower point spicules in B. lutea, in regard to which 
 Kiikenthal notes that an approach to a horizontal position 
 sometimes occurs. This dislocation of what is really a horizontal 
 band suggests the need of examining numerous polyps. 

There is a strongly developed supporting bundle, the largest 
 spicule of which, about 2 mm. in length, projects beyond the 
 polyp for about 0*75 mm. It is abutted by two strong spindles 
 on each side and by a number of smaller ones transitional to the 
 polyp. The supporting-bundle spicules are slightly curved 
 spindles, densely covered with relatively minute blunt and narrow 
 cones. The spindles of the 8 points are similar, but show the 
 characteristic hockey-club-like bend at the base. 

7. Other spicules. All over the cortex there is a felting of 
 more irregular and stouter spindles, often "f" shaped, with 
 larger and often compound blunt tubercles. No stellate forms 
 occur, but very numerous, quite irregular types are found which 
 might be derived from spindles and club-like ends or from 
 boomerangs. Their compound warts are often very strong and 
 stronger on one side.

1. Colons/ as a ivhole. Eight young colonies, the largest of 
 which measures 6*5 cm. high. They are very flaccid in texture 
 and hyaline in appearance. The youngest forms show little hint 
 of umbellate branching, but this is well marked in the biggest. 
 As the umbels do not compose large hemispherical groups, the
