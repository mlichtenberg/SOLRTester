WITHIN THE GKNUS DENDRONEPUTll YA. 55 

shows 4-5 horizontal spindles closely packed in a crown and of a 

pair of converging spindles in each of the 8 points, one member 

of the pair often larger than the other 

and projecting a little beyond the polyp. Text-fig. 14. 

The supporting bundle is very strong, 

and in it one spindle may attain a length 

of 3 mm. 

7. Other spicules. The surface of the 
 stalk is densely covered with roughly 
 tuberculate multiradiate discs, often 
 with a central knob, which fit into each 
 other. 

Deduction : — This specimen does not 
 agree with previous descriptions in 
 colouring or in showing foliaceous basal 
 branches, yet I think it should be 
 ranked within the heading of B. cervi- 

). cervicornis Wr. & Stud. 

Localities : — Stations 305, 310. 

8. Dendronephtliya mirahilis (Henderson). 

Described by Henderson in ' Alcyonarians of the Indian 
 Ocean,' Part II. pp. 49-51 (1909). 

Diagnosis : — Divaricate ; loose ; contour irregular ; distinctly 
 flattened ; polyps in small bundles of about 6 ; polyp stalks 
 medium ; supporting bundle medium ; point spicules 5 pairs, 
 with the uppermost pair slightly projecting; crown absent; 
 gi-ade lY. ; spicules : many of the stalk spicules chai-acteristic 
 in appearance because of the length and strength of the pro- 
 tuberances ; colour : colony as a whole white, polyp stalks, 
 point spicules, and supporting bundle amber-yellow. 

Anthocodial Grade and Formula : — 
 lY. = 5p + Or + medium S.B. 
 Descriptive Notes : — 

1. Colony as a tvhole. A white, divaricate colony. 

2. Branching. Loose, divaricate, with irregular contour and 
 very distinct flattening. It should therefore be referred to 
 Klikenthal's group Divaricatas, subgroup cervicornis. Yet^ it 
 agrees in several respects with Henderson's D. mirabilis, which 
 he places in the rigicla group. 

3. Colouring. Polyp stalks, spicules of the anthocodial arma- 
 ture and of the supporting bundle amber-yellow. 

4. Polyi) stalks not more than 1 mm. long. 

5. Polyps occur in small bundles of about 6 in number. 

6. Polyp spicules. The anthocodial armature consists of 
 8 double rows of about 5 pairs, converging steeply, and with the 
 uppermost pair slightly projecting. This does not agree well
