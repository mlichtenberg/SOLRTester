as long as the reserves are maintained and contain any game, so- 
 long will there be lions ; in fact, a reasonable supply of lions is, I 
 consider, a sine qua non in a reserve, for they clear off the Aveak- 
 lings and the sick, forming part of nature's scheme in a natural 
 assemblage of animals mainly composed of herbivores. Curiously 
 enough, however, during the war they increased out of proportion, 
 for although aii enormous amount of game was shot by the 
 troops, the lions were not hunted to any extent. 

The result of this was that game being scarce in the area of 
 military opeiations, numbers of lions became cattle eaters, and 
 the Masai herds which tenant the Southei-n Game Eeserve have 
 suffered heavily ; I believe that the Game Department has had to 
 take steps to reduce the number of lions there during the last 
 year or two. It is not easy to understand what normally limits- 
 the number of lions ; one never sees a lion which has died of 
 starvation or disease, and lions which are shot always appear to 
 be in a fair condition, but some cause luidoubtedly does oj^erate 
 in a natural assemblage to preserve the proportion of carnivores 
 to herbivores. 

Considerable troops of lions are sometimes seen, but it is rare. 
 Sir Frederick Jackson recorded a troop of 23 near Lukenya ; the 
 largest troop I have seen myself Avas 11, made up of 1 male, 
 4 females, and 6 half-grown cubs, neor Xgong, where I Avatched 
 the adults opened out in echelon on a hillside, hunting a herd of 
 zebra, the cubs being assembled under a tree Avatching the 
 performance, and doubtless learning the art. 

Lions haA'e noAv been Avell-nigh abolished in the older settled 
 areas and necessarily so, for no one can successfully farm stock 
 in a country Avhere lions are common. There are still, hoAvever, 
 but feAv places where domestic stock could safely be allowed to 
 stay out in a pasture all night. 

Rhinoceros. â€” This curious beast has sufiered se'/erely of recent 
 years, and great numbers hav-e been killed. The gi-eater pro- 
 portion inhabited the open plains and Avere thus conspicuous to 
 sportsmen. They haA'e irritable natures and have a stupid habit 
 of charging doAvn on anything that annoys their sense of smell. 
 In hundreds of cases this has induced their death, for many a man 
 has had to shoot a rhino in self-defence. I have myself had 
 several narroAv shaves owing to their sudden attacks. 

Many Avere killed during the Avar in the southern portion of 
 the Game Reserve by the troops of both forces. 

The high price Avhich rhino horns have commanded in the Far 
 East during the last few years has, moreover, proved an induce- 
 ment to the native hunters to slaughter these animals; they 
 were instigated by the Indian traders, Avho surreptitiously shipped 
 them out in considerable quantities. 

This beast does not make long migratoiy joiuneys. and, pro- 
 viding that the reserves are of ample size and contain an adequate
