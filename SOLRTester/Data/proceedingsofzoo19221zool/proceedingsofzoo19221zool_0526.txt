Tlie fourth nerve communicates witli tlie fiftli and becomes the 
 suprnscapular nerve, and the phrenic nerve arises from the 
 junction of the fourth and communicating branches. Filainents 
 may run from the communicating twigs from the cervical plexus 
 to suprascapular and pln-enic nerves. In Macaciis rhesus, 
 according to Brooks (1), the large fourth cervical gives a branch 
 which joins the smnll fifth cervical just as the latter gives off the 
 phrenic nerve. In Homo the phrenic nerve receives definite fibres 
 from the third, fourth, and fifth cervical nerves, and the supra- 
 scapular nerve arises from the fifth and sixth cervicals. 

The fifth, sixth, and seventh nerves quickly divide into anterior 
 and posterior divisions, but the eighth does not divide. So there

is no trace of trunks as seen in Homo, and there is no upper trunk 
 as in Macacus rhesus. 

The anterior division of the fifth nerve gives off the upper and 
 middle subscapular nerves, and unites with the anterior division 
 of the sixth to form the musculo-cutaneous and middle subscapular 
 nerves. In Macacus rhesus two small subscapulars come from the 
 posterior division of the upper trunk (C.v and C.vi). It is 
 possible that the musculo-cutaneous is the only lepresentative of 
 the outer cord of the plexus in Homo. 

The posterior branches of the fifth and sixth nerves can be 
 traced into the musculo-spiral and circumflex nerves, and the 
 musculo-spiral nerve is joined by the anterior division of the 
 seventh. In Macacus rhesus the posterior of the upper trunk 
 unites with a branch of the seventh cervical nerve to form a
