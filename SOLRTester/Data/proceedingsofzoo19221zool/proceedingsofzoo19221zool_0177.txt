matter, lighter in tint than that in the testis sac, in granules, 
 and also in larger spherical aggregations up to 20 /x in diameter. 
 The ampulla is attached by a connective-tissue mesentery to the 
 septum. 

The first part of the duct is wide— 125 /a — and has a consider- 
 able lumen ; it is lined by moderately high columnar epithelium, 
 with cilia which spring in bunches from each cell. The neck by 
 which it is joined to the ampulla is narrower, 60 /a in diameter 
 and similarly ciliated. The duct is also suspended by a mesentery. 

The coiled part of the duct is narrower, with a diameter of 
 50 /x ; it is remarkable for the great thickness of its muscular 
 coat — 15 1^1 — much more marked than in the previous portions of 
 the apparatus ; the fibres are mostly circular. The epithelium is 
 cubical and non-ciliated ; a lumen is not visible. The mesentery, 
 with marked muscular fibrils, branches to its attachment to the 
 various coils. 

The atrium in this species is small, and is contained within the 
 lower part of the septum ; it narrows downwards to pierce the 
 body- wall. The duct joins it near the apex ; but it is included 
 for some distance within a common connective and muscular coat 
 before the lumina coalesce. The epithelium of the atrium is high 
 and irregular, a,nd hence the lumen is small, and irregular also ; 
 the nuclei are situated towards the base of the cells ; there are no 
 cilia. The muscular coat is independent of the musculature of 
 the septum. In the body-wall the epithelium is lower, columnar, 
 non-ciliated ; the muscular coat is here apparently derived from 
 the circular fibres of the body-wall ; the diameter of the tube, 
 including its muscular coat, is 85 /x,. 

(7) Accessory {G ovulatory) Glands. 

The sexual animal is characterized by a number of markings, 
 each a transversely oval patch, slightly raised above the general 
 surface, with a circular groove in its centre ; these are two, three 
 or four in number, may be paired or unpaired, and may occur on 
 the ventral surface of segms. vii, viii, ix, and xii, or any of these. 

Corresponding to each of these markings there is found inter- 
 nally a small, almost spherical mass, attached to the body-wall by 
 a short stalk-like portion. On investigation by sections they pre- 
 sent the following characters (fig. 5): — 

Each is about "42 mm. in diameter, and is solid, its centre con- 
 sisting of a mass of cells. The outer thin coat of peritoneum is 
 in places perceptible only Avith difticulty; it appears as an ex- 
 tremely fine membrane with slight thickenings here and there 
 which represent much flattened nuclei ; in places it carries blood- 
 vessels. The muscular coat (m.) is very well marked — 9 /i thick ; 
 its fibres are derived from both the muscular layers of the body- 
 wall. There is no special (blue-staining) connective-tissue layer, 
 though there are traces of this tissue in between the muscular 
 fibres, as in the body-wall. 

The cells which fill up the interior of the organ (c.) are large,
