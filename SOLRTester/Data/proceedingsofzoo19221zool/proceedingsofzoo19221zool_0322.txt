Ova. — The ova, as seen in tlie vagina, are tliin-shelled. TJiey 
 are 60 /.i in length and 35 /x, in breadth. Tlie contents are in the 
 morula stage of development. 

Habitat. Intestine of African elephnnt (Uganda). 

Discussion. 

This genus is in some respects allied to Pteridopharynx. The 
 presence, however, of the cuticular collar round the anterior end 
 of the body, and the peculiarity of having a branched externo- 
 dorsal ray in the bursa, clearly differentiate the members of the 
 Sfenus Memphisia. 

The two species here described are easily sorted out, even with 
 a hand lens. The very marked and projecting cuticular collar 
 of M. memphisia, together with the spike-like female tail, suffice 
 to differentiate them. The spicules in M. aziza are shorter; 
 the distance between the anus and vulva is longer than in 
 M. memp)hisia. In addition, the total length and the diameter 
 of the various structures of the body and the position of 
 the cervical papillae and excretory pore are different in both 
 species. 

No member of this genus has been recorded from the Indian 
 elephant. 

Genus Amira Lane, 1914 (amended). 

Fairly small worms with thick cuticle. Cuticular bosses may 
 be found anterior to the male bursa. The mouth is terminal, 
 and is surrounded by an external and an internal leaf-crown. 
 There are six head papillae, none of which are prominent. 
 The mouth capsule is very short; the oesophagus is hour-glass 
 in shape, the nerve collar siirrounding the constriction. There 
 is a large oesophageal funnel. The oesophagus has a cuticular 
 lining. 

The male : The dorsal lobe of the bursa may or may not 
 be enormously elongated. The pre-bursal papillae are very much 
 elongated. The two equal spicules are of enormous length and 
 very fine. There is an accessory piece. 

The female : The vulva lies close cephalad of the anus. The 
 long vagina runs cephalad, and divides into two parallel ceplialad- 
 running uteri provided with ovejectors. The colourless thin- 
 shelled ova are segmented.

Source of Material. — The material consists of one male and five 
 females, which were sent to Prof. Leiper by Lieut.-Ool. Clayton 
 Lane. They ai^e the co-types of Amira omra.
