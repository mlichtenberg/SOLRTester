A revision of the Cichlidae of Lake Victoria is a much more 
 difficult task than tha,t of revising the Cichhdaj of Nyassa, 
 inasmuch as the types of all the described species from Nyassa 
 are in the collection of the British Museum (Natural History), 
 whereas a number of the types from Lake Victoria are in Paris, 
 Berlin, and Genoa. 

Dr. Pellegrin has kindly sent me notes on two or three species 
 in the collection of the Paris Museum about which I had some 
 doubts, and I am indebted to Mr. Boulenger for photographs 
 of the types of Hajjlochromis nuchisquamulatus, H. obliqioidens, 
 H. longirostris, and H. sauvagei, which were sent to him by the 
 late Professor Hilgendorf in 1898, and to Dr. Pappenheim for 
 information about the first two of these species. 

In Boulenger's ' Catalogue of African Freshwatei' Fishes ' 47 
 species of Cichlidee are described from Lake Victoria (including 
 the Victoria Nile, Lakes Salisbury, Kioga, etc.). The number 
 in the present revision is practically the same (50), but, as no less 
 than 18 species are described below as new and some others 
 formerly regarded as synonyms have been re-established, it will 
 be evident that a considerable number of species recognized by 
 Boulenger have been eliminated. 

A summa-iy of what is known of the Cichlidae of the great 
 African lakes may now be given t. 

From Lake Albert only three species have been recorded 
 (Tilapia jiilotica, Ilajjlochromis loingatii, and H. multicolor), all 
 of which occur also in the Bahr-el-Gebel. 

Tilapia nilotica is found inLakesEdward andKivu; in addition, 
 Lake Edward has a species of Tilajjia (T. eduardiana) which is 
 closely related to T. variahilis of Lake Victoria, 5 endemic species 
 of Hiqolochromis, 4 apparently related to H. cinereus and the fifth 
 to H. spekii, of Lake Victoria, and an endemic monotypic genus, 
 Schubotzia, distinguished from Haplochromis by the dentition. 

Kivu has five species of Haplochromis peculiar to the lake, of 
 which two seem to be related to H. cineretcs. 

From Tanganyika 89 species belonging to 37 genera are 
 known. Except 'Tilapia nilofAca, all these are endemic and the 
 majority of them belong to endemic genera. Nearly all the 
 Tanganyika Cichlidaj belong to genera which may have evolved
