The genal tuft, too, is generally indistinguishable in the latter 
 genus, although in a young specimen I have detected both genal 
 and interramal tufts, the former consisting of two vibrissjiB close 
 to the hinder corner of the eye. 

In Ccdogenys and Basyprocta the ordinaiy vibrissas are long 
 and numerous, especially those of the genal tuft in Coelogenys, 
 and the interramal tuft is present. In Dolichotis the vibrissas 
 generally resemble those of I)asy2^'>'octa ; but in an example of 
 I), scdinicola the interramal vibrissae, present in a specimen of 
 B.patagonica, were absent. In Hydrochoeriis all the vibrissse are 
 short and slender, the interramal are absent and the genal are 
 set below the level of the eye. In the typical species of Cavia 
 {C. 2^orcellus), the common guinea-pig, and in C. aperea, the 
 mystacials, superciliaries, and genals are as in the Octodontidse, 
 Dolichotis, and others, although relatively somewhat shorter; and 
 the interramals appear to be absent. But in an example of 
 Galea littoralis Thos.*, the interramals are represented by four 
 long bristles arranged along the posterior border of a neai'ly 
 naked area behind the chin, an arrangement recalling that of Ihe 
 ruminant ungulate Tragulus. 

In Chinchilla and Lagidium the mystacial vibrissse are exceed- 
 ingly long and coarse, but the superciliaries are much finer and 
 softer. The genals also, when present, are fine and soft, but I 
 found them in only one example of Chinchilla. In another 
 example of that genus and in a specimen of Lagidium I could 
 not detect them. In Lagostomus the mystacials, supei'ciliaries, 
 and genals are ail long and coarse, and this genus in addition 
 has a long thick mat of bristles on the cheek below the eye. 
 The interramals appear to be undeveloped in these three genera. 
 Ctenodactylus has long mystacials, superciliaries of medium 
 .length, but no discei'nible genals oi- interramals. 

The Mouth and Cheek-pouches. 

The mouth of the Hystricomorphs, as in other groups of 
 Rodents, is provided with lobes of skin jutting into it from the 
 cheek on each side and serving to shiTt ofl' the anterior from the 
 posterior part of the buccal cavity so as to prevent gnawed 
 fragments of wood from passing into the throat. A pair of 
 these, one on each side of the tongue, capable of meeting behind 
 the lower incisor, may be called the lingual lobes, while an upper 
 pair, capable of meeting across the palate behind the upper 
 incisors, may be called the palatal lobes. 

The lingual lobes, so far as my observations extend, always 
 retain their distinctness and can be separated or brought togethei'; 
 but the palatal lobes are more variable. Typically and in most
