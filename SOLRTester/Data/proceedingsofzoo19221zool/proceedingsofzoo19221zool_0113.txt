WITHIN THE GENUS DENDRONEPHTHYA.

Yet this specimen difiers deeply from D. hrevirama in the 
 following i-espects : 

(a) it has a different type of supporting bundle, namely a 
 sheath, instead of showing one markedly predominating 
 needle ; 
 (6) it has practically no spicules in the canal-walls ; 
 (c) it has not more than a hint of triradiates. 
 It therefore seems best to establish a new species, closely like 
 D. hrevirama (an Umbellate) in some respects and very like 
 D, japonica (a Divaricate) in others. 
 Locality : — Station not marked. 

21. Dendronephthya simplex (sp. n.). 

Diagnosis : — Umbellate ; compact ; slightly flattened umbels 
 not combined into large hemispherical masses ; lower branches 
 foliaceous ; contour uniform ; polyps compact ; polyp stalks short ; 
 supporting bundle strong ; point spicules, 2, long converging 
 only : crown of some 3 rows of curved sjDindles ; grade VI. ; 
 spicules : cortex has stout tuberculate spindles but no stars ; 
 colour : generally drab-yellow.

Descriptive Notes : — 

1. Colony as a ivJiole. The entire colony is 9 cm. high, of which 
 2-5 cm. go to the sterile stalk. The breadth of the polyparium 
 is 6 mm. The polyp-bearing twigs form small umbels, but these 
 do not combine in larger hemispherical masses. The specimen 
 should therefore be referred to iviiken- 

thal's second group of the Umbellatse 
 and to the florida group, though the 
 shape of the polyparium is rather cir- 
 cular than long oval. There is a uniform, 
 very slightly interrupted contour to the 
 whole colony, which has a somewhat 
 flattened circular shape. The general 
 appearance is compact. Practically the 
 wdiole surface is covered by the polyps 
 on their umbels, and no polyps occur 
 except on the surface. 

2. Branching. Some of the lower 
 branches are foliaceous. 

3. Colouring. On the whole the 
 colour is drab-yellow. 

4. Folyp stalks. Short. 

5. Polyps in compact bundles of 10 or so, dense corymbs. 

6. Polyp spicules. The anthocodial armature consists of 8 
 points of 2 long converging spindles each, and it may be said at 

D. simplex, sp. ii.
