the rear rows of eyes. The front median eyes are twice the 
 diameter of the front side, which are well separated from the 
 former, situated farther back and higher np, making the whole 
 row recurved. All these eyes have wide black rims. The eyes 
 of the third row are of the same diameter as the front laterals, 
 and the row is only very slightly broader than the front. The 
 small eyes of the second row are about equally distant between 
 the front laterals and the rear eyes. 

The clypeus is half the width of the front median eyes, and 
 Avholly covered with long bristly hair pointing inwards from 
 each side. 

The mandibles have long bristles at the base, with long but 
 fine hair over the remainder. The single tooth on the inner 
 side is conical and about half-way down the margin of the falx- 
 sheath. On the outer margin are two smaller teeth at the 
 lower end. 

The sternum is pear-shaped, narrowed anteriorly, the front 
 lying between the coxaj of the first pair of legs, which are the 
 widtli of the base of the lip apart. 

The abdomen is twice as long as broad, Avidest near the base 
 and narrowing to the posterior end. The downlying hair at the 
 sides of this as well as on the legs and the cephalothorax is 
 lanceolate. 

The front pair of legs is longer and stouter than the others, 
 the femur being club-sliaped. The second pair similarly shaped 
 but smaller. On the patella and femur of each of these pairs is 
 a long thick fringe of bristles — under tibia i. and ii. are three 
 pairs of spines ; under the metatarsus of i. and ii. are two pairs 
 of stout spines and one smaller spine; under metatarsus iii. 
 and iv. are two pairs of spines, one pair at the sides and a 
 hunch at the distal end.
