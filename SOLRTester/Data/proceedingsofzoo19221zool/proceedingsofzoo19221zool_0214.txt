160 MR. C. TATE REGAN ON THE 

From what 1ms been said above as to the evolution and 
 I'elatiou ships of the Cichlidre of Victoria, it will be evident that 
 I do not regard the classification here proposed as entirely 
 satisfactory. A number of divergent species are placed in 
 Haplochromis and a few extreme types are regarded as generically 
 distinct, although the close relationship of each to a species of 
 Haiylochromis is obvious. At present I am not in a position to 
 improve this arrangement.
