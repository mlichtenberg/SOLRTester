54 DR. W. RAE SUERRIFFS ON EVOLUTION 

A few spindles occur with asymmetrical, bifid ends. The polyp 
 stalks are longer than in the other forms. 
 Locality: — Station 310 B. 

The fragmentary, ivory-white colony, without a stalk, divari- 
 cate in type, in its branches inclined to be flattened, closely 
 approaches D. mollis in showing : — - 

(1) a very marked projection of one of the uppermost spicules 

of each point ; 

(2) the others (usually 3 pairs in number) much smaller; 

(3) a very strong supporting bundle with 3 specially strong 

spicules, one of which projects for at least 1 mm. ; 

(4) the dense regular covering of the spicules with short, 

blunt tubercles. 

Most of the spicules are curved spindles, many boomerang-like; 
 bifid and trifid forms occasionally occur ; here and there one is 
 almost quite smooth as also occurs in D. mollis. 

Locality: — Station 366. 

Deduction : — It appears to me that the most striking feature 
 of this species is the exaggeration of one of the terminal spicules 
 of certain anthocodial rows, but I emphasise the point that many 
 of the heads show not a trace of this. 

7. Dendronephthya cervicornis (Wright & Studer). 

Described by Wright & Studer, Rep. Sc. Res. ' Challenger,' 
 vol.xxxi. pp. 220-221 (1889). 

Diagnosis: — Divaricate; rigid; outline irregular; distinctly 
 flattened ; polyps loosely spaced ; polyp stalks long ; supporting 
 bvindle very strong ; point spicules one pair only, one member of 
 which is stronger than the other and projects somewhat : crown 
 of about 5 rows closely packed together; grade YI. ; spicules; 
 stalk surface has numerous rough multiradiate interlocking 
 discs ; colour : bright orange as a whole. 

Anthocodial Grade and Formula : — 

YI. = 2 P -f 4-5 Or + strong S.B. 
 Descriptive Notes : — 

1 . Colony as a whole. An approximately I'igid, bright orange, 
 young colony. 

2. Branching. Markedly divaricate ; outline irregular and 
 flattened ; should therefore be referred to KUkenthal's cervicornis 
 group in which, however, the only species that it approaches 
 closely is D. cervicornis itself. 

3. Oolouj'ing. Bright orange as a whole. 

4. Polyp stalks long. 

5. Polyps divergent and loosely spaced. 

6. Polyp spicules. The composition of the anthocodial armature
