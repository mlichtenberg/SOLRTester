processes from the pbaiynx. The lumen of the pharynx is 
 continuous with that of the oesophagus. 

Q'lso'pliagus. — The esophagus is long and thin. In some

Chyle intestine. — The intestine is ii'regularly bent in its course. 
 Near its commencement its wall is surrounded by a clear 
 refractile band, the natui'e of which is unknown. The cellular 
 wall is slightly pigmented. The rectum is a short canal : in most 
 cases its structure is obscured by the greatly distended genital 
 organs of the female. 

Excretory system. — The large excretory vesicle receives two 
 excretory ducts, one from the lower part of the body and one 
 from the head end. The excretory jDore is wide and is placed 
 •92 mm. from the cephalic end. It is placed on a raised papilla, 
 striated radially I'ound the pore. 

Nerve collar. — The nei've collar surrounds the thinnest part of 
 the oesophagus "22 mm. from the head end. 

Genital organs.— 'M.{(\e: The irregularly convoluted testis 
 reaches within -8 mm. from the head. The cement gland is 
 long, and the ejaculatoiy duct opens into the ventral aspect of the 
 cloaca. 

Female : In the mature female the genital tract is so distended 
 with embryos that the details of this system are practically 
 impossible to make out. By the help of an immature specimen 
 the general featui'es of the organs can be recognized. There 
 is only one ovary and one uterus, placed in the axis of the 
 body. The vagina is short, and opens in the posterior part of the 
 bod}^ •! ram. cephalad of the anus.
