Langbiana, gen. nov. 

This genus differs from Diores Sim. in having the median eye 
 area as broad as or sliglitly longer than broad. The row of 
 spinous bristles on the tibia and distal joint of the female palp is 
 lacking. The claw pectinated. There are short weak spines on 
 all joints of the legs except the tarsal. 

Langbiana klossi, sp. n. 

The cephalic part of the cephalothorax and mandibles are dark 
 red. The thoracic part, lip, maxillte. sternum, legs, and palpi 
 bright orange. The abdomen above is black-brown, with two 
 longitudinal lines of yellow-grey spots, five in each, to near the 
 posterior end, where are a few transverse lines of similar colour. 
 On the under side it is yellow at the base as far as the genital 
 fovea, below which are alternate black and rather wide yellow- 
 grey longitudinal lines, some seven in number, reaching to the

Langhiana Mossi, gen. et sp. n. 

Â«, eyes; &, lip and maxillae ; c, epigj'ne : d, spinnerets from under side. In a the 
 front laterals should be lower down and rather nearer the median than drawn. 

Both rows of eyes are procurved, the laterals of the posterior 
 row having their uppermost points on a line with the bottom of 
 the median, and the iipper points of the front laterals in a line 
 with the centres of their median. 

The eyes of the rear row and the laterals of the front row are 
 each about two-thirds the diameter of the front median. The 
 latter are half their diameter apart and twice that distance from 
 the rear median, which are their own diameter apart and twice 
 their diameter from their laterals.
