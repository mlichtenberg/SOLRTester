•06 mm. in length in the male, '08 mm. in the female. The 
 diameter is -14 mm. in both sexes. 

External leaf-crown. — The external leaf-crown consists of 
 twelve leaflets. These are the most prominent characteristic of 
 the species in their a]>pearance and arrangement. They are broad, 
 leaf-like, and slightly bent at the tip. They do not protrude 
 above the head. 

Head jJapilloi. — The four submedian head papillae are displaced 
 laterally by the external leaf-crown. They project directly 
 forwards, and each is surmounted by a small papilla, the nature 
 of which is referred to elsewhere. The lateral papillae do not 
 pi'oject, and their termination is marked by a depression. 

Cervical papillce. — The two laterally placed cervical papillae are 
 directed slightly cephalad. They lie '7 mm. from the head end 
 in the male and '86 mm. in the female.

Quilonia ethiojoica, sp. n. Head. 

Mouth capsule. — The chitinous mouth capsule is extremely 
 shallow. In optical cross-section it lies oblique to the axis of 
 the body. It is "018 mm. in depth and "12 mm. in diameter. The 
 chitinous mouth capside does not come in contact with the wall 
 of the oral cavity. The latter is practically cylindrical in shape 
 and slightly contracted in the middle. There are apparently no 
 teeth projecting into the mouth cavity. 

Internal leaf-croion. — The twelve leaflets of the internal leaf- 
 crown can be traced from the floor of the mouth canity to about 
 its middle. Each leaflet is broad at its base and tapers to a 
 point. It has a distinct cleft in the middle, and thus each is 
 really two leaflets side by side. 

CEsophagus. — There is a shallow esophageal funnel surrounded 
 by a chitinous rim lying on the three ossophageal columns. 
 The oesophagus is short and thick. It is "SS mm. in length in the 
 male and "57 mm. in the fema,le. It is slightly narrowed at the
