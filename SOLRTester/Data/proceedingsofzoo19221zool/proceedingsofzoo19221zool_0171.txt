111 a third paper (6) Beddard refers to a recent paper of Rosa's 
 on Desmogaster dorice, a member of another genus of Monili- 
 gastrida^ (19) ; there is here the same annular layer of muscular 
 fibres outside the lining epitlielium, and in addition muscular 
 fibres are interspersed between the bundles of glandular cells ; 
 a delicate peritoneal investment surrounds the whole. Rosa, 
 however, states that the gland cells empty into the lumen of the 
 prostate by long ducts, and the figure also indicates tha,t these 
 ducts— apparently prolongations of the cells — pierce the layer of 
 circular muscular fibres ; nevertheless, Beddard thinks it is still 
 possible to refer all that lies outside of the lining epithelium to 
 the peritoneum (using " peritoneum " in a wide sense, Beddard 
 speaks of the muscular layer also as having been developed from 
 the peritoneum). 

Beddard also gives an account of the prostate of I), hahamensis 
 (7). The gland-cells lie in groups in the interstices of a some- 
 wiiat loosely arranged muscular mass ; the ducts of the cells — 
 simply filiform prolongations of their substance — pierce the 
 muscular layer in bundles, and evidently pour their secretion 
 into the lumen. There is no peritoneal layer outside. 

Benham examined Moniligaster indicus {=Drawida rohusta) 
 (10) ; the specimens were badly preserved. The necks of the 
 glandular cells pass through the muscular coat nearly up to the 
 epithelium, but not quite. The epithelium is traversed by 
 narrow, clear tubes resembling ducts, which difier from the 
 epithelial cells in having no inner boundary. There is a coelomic 
 epithelium outside ; hence the gland cells are not peritoneal, and 
 must belong to the layer of epithelial cells. 

Bourne, in D. grandis (11), found the gland cells arranged in 
 groups, each cell, however, sending its duct to take its place 
 among the columnar cells of the epithelial lining. There are two 
 layers of muscle — one overlying the epithelial layer a.nd within 
 the glandular layer, and another outside the glandular layer ; a 
 layer of ccelomic epithelium invests the whole. 

There is thus an exti-aordinary variety in the accounts of this 
 organ. The layer of gland cells is said to be separate from the 
 epithelial layer, and to send prolongations as ducts through the 
 epithelium to the lumen ; to have outside it a peritoneal invest- 
 ment, and to have no such layer; and to belong to the epithelial 
 layer, or to the peritoneal layer. In the present species there 
 seems to be no doubt that there is a peritoneal layer outside the 
 layer of glandular cells ; but equally definitely these latter seem 
 to be altogether cut oif from the epithelial layer and the lumen 
 of the organ. I am disposed to believe that the cells belong to 
 the peritoneum rather than to the lining epithelium ; and to 
 agree with Beddard, who would hold that the presence of a 
 flattened peritoneal layer outside the glandular cells does not 
 preclude the peritoneal origin of these latter. 

In the present species the prostates (fig. 3) are situated in
