Winge vE Museo Luiidi, i. pt. iii. pp. 126-135, 1888) differed 
 from Alston in some particuhirs. He referred all the Hystri- 
 comorphs to one family Hystricidcii?, which was divided into tiie 
 following subfamilies : — 

(1) Octodontini, equivalent to Alston's Octodontina; + Echino- 
 myina? ; (2) Cnpromyini, for Aulacodus, Capromys, Flagio- 
 doniia, and Mi/o^^otanius : (3) Otenodactylini, tor Cteno- 
 dactylvs, Pectinator, and Fetromys; (4) Hystricini and 
 (5) Eriomyini, equivalent to Alston's Hystricidje and 
 Chinchillidre respectively ; and (6) Dasyproctini, embracing 
 all the geneia refei^red by Alston to the Dasyproctidje, 
 Dinomyidae, and Caviidse. 

Thomas (P. Z. S. 1896, pp. 1024-1025) made the following 
 changes in Alston's system. Following Winge, he transferred 
 Fetromys from the Octodontin?e to the Ctenodactylinse, and 
 removed Ca'promys, Myocastor [ATyopotamits), and Thrynomys 
 {Aidacodus) from the Echinomyinfe to form the subfamily 
 Capromyinae. He also altered the name Echinomyinae to Lon- 
 cherinfe, gave full family-rank to the Old World and New World 
 Porcupines respectively, calling the former Hystricidfe and the 
 latter Erethizontidse and dividing this family into two subfamilies 
 — Cha^tomyinfe for Chcetomys and ErethizontinaB for Erethizoii and 
 Coen du (jSphingurtis ) . 

TuUberg (Nova Acta Sci. Upsala, (3) xviii. pp. 82-149, 1900) 
 introduced some innovations, notably the institution of two new 
 families — the Aulacodidee for Aidacodus {Thrynomys), previously 
 associated with Cap>romys and Myocastor, and the PetiomyidaB 
 for Fetromys alone, severing the latter both fi-om the Echino- 
 myida? and the Ctenodactylidse. He refused, moreover, to admit 
 the affinities of the Ctenodactylinfe with the Hystricomorphs, 
 classifying them with his Myomorph + Sciuromorph division of 
 Rodentia. He fused the two families Dasyproctidae and Caviida^ 
 of Alston into one called CaviidfB, keeping Dinomys provisionally 
 as the type of a special family till more is known abovit it. The 
 family-name Octodontidae he changed to Echinomyidse, and 
 altered Capromyinae to Myopotamini. 

Beddard's classification ('Mammalia,' pp. 487-502, 1902) 
 differed from Thomas's in I'ostoring Fetromys to a place in the 
 Octodontinae, where Alston put it, and in granting familj'^-rank 
 to the Ctenodactyline genera, Cteiiodactylus, Fectinator, and 
 Massouteria. 

Weber (Die Saug. pp. 505-507, 1904) admitted no subfamilies, 
 placing the genera in seven families as follows : — (1) Ctenodacty - 
 lidte {Clenodactylus, Fetromys, Fectinator) ; (2) Octodontidae 
 (Ctenomys, Octodon, Ahrocoma, Loncheres, Echinomys); (3) 
 Capromyidae [Capromys, Myocastor, ? Th.rijnomys) ; (4) Chin- 
 chiWidse {Chinchilla, Lagidiu7n, Lagostomits) ; (5) Caviidae {Cvelo- 
 genys, Dasyprocta, Cavia, Dolichotis, Hydrochoerus) ; (6) Erethi-
