Fortiiiuitely, as the result of the work of Sollas and others, Ave 
 now know the skull fairl}' well. In the temporal i-egion there is 
 a single supratem2:)oral fossa. Uehiiul and below the fossa are 
 two large membrane-bones, which have given rise to much 
 difference of opinion. By some, the upper bone has been looked 
 upon as the squamosal and the lower called the supratemporal. 
 Most i-ecent writers, however, have identified the lower bone 
 as the squamosal and the upper the supratemporal. I am also

 extremely specialised skull like that of Iclithyosaurus the relations 
 of the bones are manifestly somewhat modified from what was the 
 primitive condition, but it is agreed by most that the two bones 
 are undoubtedly the homologues of the two bones usually found 
 behind the temporal fossa in lizards. These I have elsewhere 
 agreed are the squamosal and tabular. The supratemporal in the 
 Stegocephalians and those Cotylosaurs in which it occurs is 
 apparently merely a roofing-bone with no other important
