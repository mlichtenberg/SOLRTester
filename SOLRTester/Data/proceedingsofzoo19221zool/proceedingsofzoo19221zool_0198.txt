DR. C. F. SONNTAG ON THE VAGUS AND 

The Cardiac Nerves (text-fig. 6,/*) arise on the left side from the 
 vagus distal to the oi'igin of the left recurrent nerve, but the 
 right ones arise from the vagus and its recurrent branch. They 
 run to the cardiac plexus whei-ein they become associated with 
 the sympathetic (c.B.s). 

The oesophageal nerves (text-figs. 6, oisr, 7, on, and 8, vb) arise in 
 the neck from the cords uniting the laryngeal nerves. In the 
 upper part of the thorax they are branches of the right vagus, 
 but they come from the two divisions of the left vagus distal to 
 the roots of the lungs. 

The tracheal nerves (text-figs. 6, t.n and 7, t.n) arise from the 
 laryngeal cords in the neck, but its terminal part and the main 
 bronchi receive their nerve-supply from the thick bridge between 
 the vagi (hr).

The Lower Thoracic and Abdominal Parts of the "Vagus Nerves of Si/rax 
 capensis. L. V : parts of left vagus ; E.V : right vagus. Other letters 
 in text. 

The pulmonary plexuses (text-fig. 7,g): — The right one is 
 formed by two brauches from the i-ight vagus and communi- 
 cating twigs from the deep cardiac plexus. But the left one 
 consists of many branches from the bridge between the two vagi. 
 The latter sends a branch to the aortic 2:)lexus (a.p), which receives 
 many twigs from the left vagus. And no ganglia were found in 
 the pulmonary and aortic plexuses. 

The Gastric Nerves (text-fig. 7) : — The left vagus reaches the 
 stomach along the ventral border of the oesophagus and breaks 
 up into two branches. The first gives oflf twigs which run along
