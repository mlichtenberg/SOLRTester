The suhscapnlaris arises from tlie entire subscapular fossa, and 
 lias a great ailmixture of sti'ong tendinous fibres. The latter 
 converge and pass over the lesser tuberosity to be inserted into 
 its upper border. The tuberosity with these tendons presents a 
 full, rounded appearance. 

The su'prasjnnatus arises from the outer two-thirds of the supra- 
 spinous fossa and is inserted into the upper part of the great 
 tubei'osity of the humerus. The infraspinatus arises from the 
 outer two-thirds of the infi-aspinous fossa. It is inserted by two 
 heads into the great tuberosity of the humerus and the bone 
 beyond it, so as to displace the insertion of the teres minor 
 distally (text-fig. 12 0). 

The biceps arises b}^ two heads as in Man, the short one joining 
 the long one in the upper third of the arm. The muscle con- 
 verges to a long, flat tendon wdiich is inserted into the dorsal

aspect of the proximal part of the radius from the head to the 
 point where the bone begins to exhibit its marked forward con- 
 vexity (text-fig. 12 B). It first narrows slightly and expands 
 later. There is no bicipital fascia as in Man. 

The coraco-hrachialis has a long, powerful tendon of origin and 
 an elongated fleshy belly inserted into the shaft of the humerus 
 close to the deltoid insertion. 

The hrachiaUs anticits arises as in Man. It has a very strong 
 tendon which winds round the internal condyle of the humerus, 
 and is inserted into the upper inch of the inner surface of the 
 shaft of the idna, and the internal lateral ligament of the elbow 
 joint (text-fig. 12 B). 

The triceps is a very powerful muscle. Its long head arises
