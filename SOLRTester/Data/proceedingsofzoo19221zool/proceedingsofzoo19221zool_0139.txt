OP THE WATER-BEETLE PELOBIUS TARDUS. 95 

This work on the life-history of Felohlns was begun in 1915 as 
 the commencement of a study of subacjuatic beetle larvse, my 
 intention then being to work out the life-histories of a Gyrinid 
 and an Haliplid. Tlie work on Felobms was almost completed 
 by the autumn of that year, when military duties took me away 
 from Cambridge. 

Since my return to entomological work, time has not permitted 
 me to continue on this line of research, and I have therefore 
 merely completed a number of observations on Pelohius and 
 written up the life-history of the beetle.
