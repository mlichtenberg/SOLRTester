AND ZOOGEOGRAPHY OF INDIAN OLIGOCH^TA. 147 

segments x-xi and xii-xiii respectively, and with an oesophageal 
 gizzard, are held to be the present-day representatives of "the 
 common ancestor. The Phreoryctidae are probably in turn to be 
 derived from the Lumbriculidse, where the number of gonads is 
 variable, and also their position; Lamprodrilus satyriscus has 
 three or four pairs of testes, and other forms — e, g., Luonbriculus 
 variegatHs—h.a,ve more than one pair of ovaries. 

But on the above hypothesis of the origin of the terrestrial 
 families of Oligochaeta we require as our starting-point a form 
 with a series of five pairs of gonads — three pairs of testes and two 
 pairs of ovaries ; while the discovery of Syngenodrilus makes it 
 probable that the ancestor of the Moniligastrid^ had no special 
 thickening of either oesophagus or anterior intestine — the gizzards 
 developed independently in the two subfamilies, in the Syn- 
 genodrilinae in front of and in the Moniligastridee behind 
 the testicular segments. It is obvious, therefore, that the 
 Phreoryctidse are already too specialized for our purpose ; the 
 ancestral form as here conceived has a lai^ger number of s'onads, 
 and is without an oesophageal gizzard. The ancestral group more 
 nearly resembled the Lumbricididae than the Pbreoryctid^ ; the 
 latter ai-e not in the direct line of descent of the earthworms. 

The Moniligastridfe, which, as Beddard has repeatedly insisterl, 
 retain many of the characters of the Limicoline section (clitellum 
 one cell only in thickness, non-union of the vasa deferentia of the 
 same side, vasa deferentia passing over only one segment), arose 
 independently of the other earthworms by the disappearance of 
 testes from seguient xi and of ovaries from xiii, and the con- 
 traction of the original segments x and xii to form testis sacs ; 
 while the common stem of the Megascolecidas, Glossoscolecidte, 
 and Lumbricidse originated by the disappearance of testes from 
 xii and ovaries from xiv, the lengthening of the vasa deferentia, 
 and the union of those of the same side.
