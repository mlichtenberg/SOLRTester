CHARACTERS OF SOME HYSTRICOMORPH RODENTS. 421 

subservient to aquatic life. It is used mainly as a rudder, hardly 
 as a propeller, in swimming. 

In the Hystricidae the tail is always pi-ovided with a sounding- 
 organ formed of modified hairs. In the most primitive type 
 Trichys, in which the ai-mature of the body-skin consists of a 
 coating of very coarse sharp bristles, nearly uniform in length, the 
 tail is long and cylindrical, and covei-ed, except at the root and 
 tip, with scales and short hairs ; and the sounding-organ or rattle 
 at the tip consists of a brush of long flattened hairs or spines 
 somewhat resembling dried blades of grass. In Atherura the 
 tail, although still scaly and hairy, is much shorter, and each of 
 the constituent parts of the terminal brush consists of a filiform 
 axis expanding along its course into a series of compressed but 
 hollow fusiform swellings, from two to seven or eight in number, 
 according to the length of the blade. These swellings vary in 
 size, but the one at the end is always much larger than the next 
 of the series. 

In Thecurus, Acanthion, and Hystrix, in which the spine- 
 armature reaches its maximum of development, the tail is quite 
 short and thick and without scales and hairs ; but twenty or 
 more of its terminal quills are expanded into hollow flattened 
 laminae or cylinders, for the most part open at the end. This is 
 the most highly specialised rattle in the group. 

The so-called arboreal Porcupines of America (Erethizontidse) 
 fall into two sharply defined groups by their tails. In the North 
 American genus Erethizon this organ is quite short and armed 
 throughout with spines resembling those on the body. By 
 swinging it to I'ight and left, the animal uses it as a weapon of 
 defence. In the tropical American genera Coendu and Chcetomys 
 the tail is long, siabcylindrical, tapering, and covered with spines 
 and hairs and clistally with scales, although the extremity, which is 
 upcurled and prehensile, is naked above. The underside at the 
 base is thickly covered with close-set, stiff, sharp bristles, the 
 function of which, as Waterhouse rightly supposed, is to help 
 in the ascent of vertical or steeply sloping branches, and to give 
 support to the body when the animal is at rest. They are func- 
 tionally comparable to the caudal scales of the Anomaluridae. 

In the three genera assigned to the Chinchillidse, namely 
 Chinchilla, Lagiclium, and Lagostomus, the tail is also charac- 
 teristic. It is moderately long, covered with hairs, which are 
 comparatively short and soft all along the underside, but on 
 the upperside are coarse and very long â€” forming, as it were, 
 a brush. 

In the Dasyproctida3 and Caviidse the tail is reduced. In 
 Myoprocta it is at most a few inches long, but quite slender. 
 In Dasyprocta it is only about an inch or less. In Ocelogenys 
 it is about the same. In Dolichotis it is also quite short, but 
 constricted at the base and oval in outline from above or below. 
 In Hydrochcerus it is at most a short conical excrescence as it is 
 in Gavia, Gcdea, and Kerodon, and is sometimes absent.
