thing). But there is no reason to suppose tliat Eupolygaster and 
 Drmvida had a common origin — the reverse in fact ; and if they 
 originated separately, this curious dislocation must have occurred 
 twice independently. 

I believe the explanation to be that the accepted numbering of 
 the segments in Desmogaster is incorrect, and that the numbers 
 given to all the segments should be diminished by one. This 
 view requii'es some justification. 

There are three means of establishing the enumeration of the 
 segments at the anterior end of the body — the set*, which 
 commonly begin in segment ii ; the septa, which are, however, 
 invariably wanting in the anterior segments ; and the annulation 
 of the body. Of the four species of Desmogaster, the setae are 
 invisible in the anterior segments in D. dorice ; they do not begin 
 till segment viii (laterally not till ix) in D. schildi ; they do not 
 begin till segment ix in D. giardi ; and we have no information 
 concerning them in D. horsti, except that they are minute. The 
 setae are thus useless for the determination of segments. 

As to the septa, in all species the extreme displacement of 
 the septa in the anterior part of the body is remai-ked by the 
 authors. In D. horsti the tenth septum (presumably the meaning 
 is septum 10/11) is either absent, or displaced backwards to the 
 level of 11/12 ; if we suppose it to be absent, the numbering of 
 the segments is brought up to that which is generally accepted 
 for the genus, while if w^e make no such supposition, the numbering 
 of the segments is apparently that for which I am contending. 

Concerning the annulation, we only know that in D. horsti 
 "the two antBrior segments have their longitudinal diameter 
 smaller than that of the succeeding ones " — which appears to 
 admit of the supposition that they really constitute a single 
 segment ; and that in D. schildi segments i-iii are simple while 
 iv-xii are biannular. But since there are no setsB near the 
 anterior end of this worm, the distinction of primary and secon- 
 dary grooves is conceivably somewhat arbitrary, and a slight 
 difFei^ence in estimating the value of the grooves would reduce 
 the number of segments by one. It is worth noticing that in a 
 species of Eupolygaster {E. broioni, 13) Michaelsen is in doubt 
 regarding the numbering of the segments because of the secondary 
 annulation, setse being absent here also from the anterior 
 segments. 

Naturally, when the numbering of the segments had once been 
 determined in the first species of Desmogaster (rightly or wrongly), 
 subsequent writers describing new species w^ould, if in any doubt, 
 bring their numbering to correspond, as Michaelsen does in the 
 example of the Eupolygaster just quoted *. 

* The first species of Desmogaster to be described was D. doriee (Rosa, 19). 
 There seem to be inconsistencies in the data there given. The ovaries are said to be 
 in segm. xiii ; but the funnels to be on anterior face of septum 14/15 — i.e., in segment 
 xiv. The spermathecse (there is onlj' a single pair in this species) are first stated to 
 be in viii, but further on to be on the posterior face of septum 6/7 — i.e., in vii. This 
 would seem to indicate that the estimation of the segments was not easy, and that 
 the author himself came to difterent results at different times.
