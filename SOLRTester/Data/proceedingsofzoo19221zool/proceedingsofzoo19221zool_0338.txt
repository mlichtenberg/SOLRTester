98 mammals and 93 reptiles have died. This gives a percentage 
 of 10-0 for mammals and 8-1 for reptiles. 

It is not possible to give an accurate figure for birds, since so 
 many of the smaller birds of the same species are kept together, 
 which makes it impossible to distinguish a bird which has been 
 in the Gardens a month from one which has been there a year. 

Explanatory Notes. 

1. Empysema. — This occurred in a black bear. 

3. Nephritis. — The small incidence of this disease referred to 

last year has continued. It is noted to increase among 

the mammals in cold weather.
