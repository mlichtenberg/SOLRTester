MECHANISM OF THE AMPULLARIIIXE. 343- 

negative ; but as the qnestion is very obscure and at the same 
 time connected with tiie whole question of the respiratory 
 meclianism, we may attempt to make the issue a little clearer. 

Bavay and Bouvier (2 a) imply that the siphon and I'espiratory 
 orifice form a continuous tube. If this is the case, the air 
 from the exterior passes down the siphon straight into the lung 
 and none of it is wasted in the pallial cavity. As to the details, 
 Bous'ier is the more explicit. After admitting that during the 
 act of siphonal breathing it is impossible to see what is going on 
 in the pallial cavity, he says that afterwards the ' plancher pul- 
 monaire ' becomes visible {i.e. by the modification of tlie shape of 
 the siphon and its base) and that it is " susceptible de faire saillie 
 en avant jusqu'au voisinage de la base du siphon." The chief 
 thing to notice is that during the actual process of siphonal 
 breathing it is impossible to see what is going on inside the pallial 
 cavity. It is a controversial point whether one is entitled to 
 assume that siphon and pulmonarj" orifice are continuous at a 
 given moment because a little while afterwards the latter is found 
 projecting towards the former! It is thus diiiicult to see on what 
 critical facts Bouvier and Bavay based their statements. As fai" 
 as A. vermifor I his is concerned, even if it is seized during siphonal 
 breathing and the pallial cavity foi"ced« open, the siphon resumes 
 its normal shape before the base and respiratory orifice come 
 into view. 

A j)riori one would be tempted to assume that the connection 
 in question is necessary. It would be physiologically advanta- 
 geous to have a means whereby the air is conveyed straight into- 
 the lung and not wasted in the pallial cavity. It might also be 
 desirable to keep air aAvay from the gill. But we may point out 
 («) that the siphon is not used at all in direct pulmonary breathing,, 
 so that the question of physiological economy does not seem to be 
 involved, and (h) that during siphonal respiration the mantle 
 cavity is kept tightly closed by the down-drawing of the mantle 
 folds, so that there is no risk of water entering the cavity and 
 finding its way into the lung, 

C. A comparison of the observations npoii Neotropical forms 
 with those published by Ilamanan(7)npon the Oi'\(intn\ Pachylabra 
 glohosa and by Bouvier and Fischer upon the Egyptian Lanistes 
 holteniana, suggests that the structural difierences upon which 
 Fischer (5) separated the American, Indian, and African forms 
 are correlated with difli"erences in the mode of respiration. 

Fischer divides the Ampullariidee into the following genera : — 

1. Ainpullaria s. s. including Marisa (=Ceratodes) : siphon 

very long. America. 

2. Pachylahra : siphon rudimentary. Africa, Asia, Oceania. 

3. Asolene : siphon absent. South America. 

4. Lanistes: (siphon?). Africa, Madagascar. 

5. Meladomas : (siphon ?). Africa.
