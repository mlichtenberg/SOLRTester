Descriptive Notes : — 

1 . Colony as a whole. Divaricate ; witl.out regular outline ; 
 somewhat flattened ; with loose clusters of polyps ; agrees generally 
 with Henderson's description. 4 colonies in all. 

2. Branching. Short. 

3. Colour. General surface wliite, with the spicules of the 
 anthocodise and suppoi^ting bundles coral -pink. 

4. Polyp stalks. Long. 

5. Polyps in loose clusters of 6 or so. 

6. Polyp spicules. The anthocodial 
 8 points 'consist of two curved spindles, 
 one always larger than the other and 
 projecting markedly beyond the polyp. 
 The crown shows 3 rather loose hori- 
 zontal rows, while below these and pro- 
 jecting outwards there are 8 stronger 
 spindles approaching in size those of the 
 points. 

The supporting bundle is strongly 
 developed, and consists of one very pre- 
 dominant spindle based in numerous 
 small ones. 

7. Other spicules. On the aboral sur- 
 face of the tentacles the armature is 
 very conspicuous. Very characteristic 
 in the cortex among the strong spindles 
 are numerous small, irregular, \\ arty spicules, often triradiate or 
 with irregular rays in different directions. Among them are 
 minute warty capstans like those figured by Henderson for the 
 canal-walls. 

Locality: — Station 125. 

Another specimen with the same anthocodial armature, notably 
 two unequal curved spindles rising in each point from a crown 
 of 2-3 longitudinal rows, has a regular outline and only a slight 
 hint of flattening. The spicules are coarsely tubei^culate spindles 
 and numerous irregular warty discs. 

The spicules of the anthocodial and supporting bundles are 
 amber-red and those of the general surface are golden yellow.
