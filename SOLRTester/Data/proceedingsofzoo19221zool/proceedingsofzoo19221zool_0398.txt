Oribis have peculiar inguinal glfi.nds, and in these Angolan 
 Oribis they were very noticeable. They are covered at the sides 
 by a modiHed pouch, consisting of a pair of flaps of tough pai-ch- 
 menc-like granular skin with serrated edges, sparsely covered 
 with coarse white hairs and enveloping the genital organs of the 
 male and the mammte of the female. The female seems to show 
 a greater development of this curious growth than the male. 

This peculiarity is bi'iefly referred to by Roosevelt in ' African 
 Game Animals,' ii. p. 555. as follows : — " At the groin are a pair 
 of deep inguinal sacs marked by a growth of long peculiar pithy 
 hairs." 

Pocock*, in describing these inguinal glands in Ourebia, gives 
 examples of their variation in the different i^aces of that genus, 
 notably in nigricaudatct-, montana, and ourehi. 

Since my observations of these glands in the case of rutilus 
 differ in some respects from his descriptions, it is probable that 
 this variability is characteristic of the genus.

In my collection of Antelopes from Angola I brought back- 
 seven specimens of a Grimm's Duiker from the countr}' between 
 the Quanza and Luando Rivers. These have been found to agree 
 best with Herr 0. Neumann's description of his leitcoproso^nis, 
 which he thought might have come from the interior of Angola, and 
 in this supposition he was probably correct. He describes as his 
 type a male living with a female in the Berlin Zoological Gardens. 
 The female he referred to Cephalophus aliifrons ( = octdaris) Peters 
 from Mozambique or to flavescens Lorenz from Matabeleland as 
 being greyish brown in colour with less white on the imder parts. 
 But he gives a very full and careful description of the male, to 
 which the above specimens conform most accurately, and especially 
 touching the masked or spectacled appearance of the face viewed 
 frontally, due to the white rings encircling the eyes. 

There are two skins of S. S2}lendidiilus Gray and also a stuffed 
 specimen in the B. M. collection, all from Angola. They represent
