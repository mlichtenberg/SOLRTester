110 DR. J. STEPHENSON ON THE MORPHOLOGY, CLASSIFICATION, 

of the genital organs, but altliougli I had a numbei' of specimens, 
 including one in a very en-rly stage, I did not discover the testes 
 (" the testes seem to disappear early, and I could not distinguish 
 them in a specimen which showed sperm-morulfe in all stages of 
 development, but no other genital organs, male or female, except 
 the ovaries in an early stage"). 

Since that date I have again met with numbers of sexual 
 specimens of this species, and have always looked for the testes, 
 but have never found them, even in the earliest stages of 
 sexuality. On the contrary, careful examination of the Hving 
 animal (which is very transpai-ent), of stainefl specimens, and of 
 sections, have united to convince me that the male cells are 
 produced in various parts of the body ; and not only so- — their 
 production is not limited to the parent animal of the chain, but 
 is spread over the whole series of individuals, and occuis in the 
 youngest members of the chain, which are scarcely recognizable 
 as separate entities, as well as in the most advanced. 

The situations where the male cells arise are mainh'^ as 
 follows : — 

(1) On strands passing between the alimentary canal and 
 parietes. The genus as a whole, and certainly this species, is 
 remarkable for the incompleteness of the septa ; in this species 
 there is nowhere a definite diaphragm across the coelomic space ; 
 and many of the strands, in various parts of the animal, from 
 which some of the sexual cells arise, should no doubt be regarded 
 as representing septa. 

(2) On the inner surface of the body-wall, often in the angle 
 where one of these strands joins the parietes. 

(3) In the new cellular-tissue which is formed in abundance 
 as a ring round the body at the site of the future divisions of 
 the animal. This cellular tissue gives rise to a number of new 
 segments ; the region is hence called the budding zone, and the 
 production of this embryonic tissue is the first sign of subsequent 
 fission. 

I propose to select as an example for description one out of 
 numerous observations, and then to add some account of the 
 appearances in sections, concluding with a few general remarks. 
 I may say that I have been particularly alive to one (I think 
 the only) source of possible error — namely, that the testes might 
 be quite inconspicuous masses in the normal position, that the 
 sexual cells might be detached very early in their history, and 
 the developing morulse, wandering widely through the body, 
 become attached to the body- wall or to strands in various 
 regions, so simulating the production of morulse in these 
 situations. This would, a priori, not be impossible, for the 
 following reason : — There are, in this species, no sperm- sacs or 
 ovisacs, and this seems to depend on the incompleteness of the 
 septa, of certain of which the sacs, in other genera, are backward 
 protrusions ; the sexual products, instead of being received into
