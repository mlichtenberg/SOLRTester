52 DR. W. RAE SHERRIFFS ON KVOLUTION 

spicules : canal-walls show numerous forms with greatly deve- 
 loped thorns ; colour : cortex and polyps have deep red spicules, 
 polyps grey-yellow. 

Anthocodial Grade and Formula : — 

YI. = I + 1 P + 4-6 Cr + medium S.B. 
 Descriptive Notes : — 

1. Colony as a whole. Two handsome colonies agreeing very 
 well with Holm's figures. 

2. Branching. Markedly divaricate, of irregular outline, not 
 obviously flattened, and should be referred to Kukenthal's 
 suensoni gi'oup of the Divaricatse. 

3. Colouring. Deep rose-red spicules Text-fio' 12 
 on cortex and polyps ; polyps themselves 

apart from the spicules are yellowish --.., ..--- 

grey. 

4. Polyp stalks about 1"3 mm. long. 

5. Polyps in little groups (4-10) 
 distinctly scattered. 

6. Polyp spicules. Anthocodiae show 
 8 points, each consisting of a long, 
 projecting curved spindle with a much 
 smaller one at its base, the two being 
 obviously members of a pair. These 
 points rise from a crown of about 6 rows 
 of horizontally disposed curved spindles. B. suensoni \lo\m 
 The supporting bundle consists of only 

three strong spindles up to 3 mm. long, one of which projects for 
 only a short distance. 

7. Other spicules. The canal-wall contains numerous forms 
 with conspicuously developed thorns. 

Locality : — Station 164. 

6. Dendronephthya mollis (Holm). 

Described by Holm, Zool. Jahrb. viii. Syst. pp. 51-53 (1895), 
 Diagnosis : — Divaricate ; contour regular ; not flattened ; 
 polyps in groups of about 10 ; polyp stalks medium ; supporting 
 bundle very strong ; point spicules 4 pairs with uppermost pair 
 (or one of that pair only) strong and projecting; no crown; 
 grade lY ; spicules : stalk has rough spindles, triradiates and 
 quadriradiates ; colour : general surface white, anthocodial 
 armature and supporting bundles red-brown. 

Anthocodial Grade and Formula: — 

lY. = 1-2 P + 3 p -H Or + very strong S.B. 
 Descriptive Notes : — 

1. Colony as a whole. Four colonies of white general surface, 
 two of which are obviously young and are fragmentary. 

2. Branching. Divaricate, regular outline, not flattened.
