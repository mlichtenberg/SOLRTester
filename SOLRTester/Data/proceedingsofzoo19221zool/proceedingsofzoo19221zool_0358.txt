302 MR, H. R. HOGG ON SOME 

The median quadrilateral is longer than broad and narrower 
 in front than at the rear. The clypeus is as deep as the median 
 eye-area, perpendicular, and slightly hollowed below th.e front 
 row of eyes. The mandibles are conical, with three small teeth 
 ■on the inner margin of the falx-sheath. 

The lip is straight in front, broader than long, with the maxillae 
 .slightly inclined over it and barely twice as high as the lip. 

The sternum is as broad as long, truncate in front, rounded at 
 the sides, the blunt rear end passing between the rear coxae. 
 The whole area is distinctly convex. 

The joints of the legs are cylindrical and fine. There are a few 
 short spines on the tibial and metatarsal joints, witli a bunch at 
 the distal end of the latter. The superior tarsal claws have 
 about six pectinations at the basal end. 

The abdomen is ovate, broadest anterioi-ly and truncate 
 posteriorly, and is furnished with a thin coating of downlying 
 plumose hair and scattered upright plain hair. The inferior 
 spinnerets are cylindrical, their diameter apart, covered both 
 with the plumose hair and longer fine bristles. A ver}^ short 
 hemispherical 2nd joint inside the circular termination of the 
 1st. The 1st joint of the superior is about the same length 
 and shape as that of the inferior, with a 2nd joint longer and 
 tapering to a fine point.

These are two males, neither quite adult, from the Langbian 
 Peaks, S. Annan, 6500 ft. The genus seems to be very poorly 
 represented in any of the surrounding areas, and I have little 
 doubt that the species is hitherto undescribed, as also the 
 following from the same part.

A non-adult female and fully adult male from the same locality, 
 while resembling the above in the more important respects, 
 can readily be distinguished therefrom.
