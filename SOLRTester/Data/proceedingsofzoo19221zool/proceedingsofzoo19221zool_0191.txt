(7) The. Origin of Terrestrial Olvjochmta. 

From an ancestor having the characters illustrated above 
 (text-fig. 19), then, we can derive the various genera of Monili- 
 gastrida3 without, as it seems to me, forcing the facts in any way, 
 and relying only on processes which can be illustrated from 
 actual examples of the genera themselves or of other families of 
 Oligochaeta. 

I was, however, surprised, and I must confess to feebng 
 pleased, to find that the diagram arrived at as above gives in a 
 very natural way a starting-point for the other families of 
 terrestrial Oligochteta as well. These all agree in having, 
 primarily, two pairs of testes in segments x and xi, and one pair 
 of ovaries in xiii ; the primary number of spermathecas in the 
 Megascolecidfe is two pairs, opening in grooves 7/8 and 8/9. For 
 the'oiossoscolecidfe and Lumbricida? it is not so easy to give the 
 primitive position of the spermatheca? ; perhaps all that can be 
 said is that the Glossoscolecinse, probably the ancestral group of 
 these two families, typically have spermathecae Avhich open in 
 front of the testis segments (Michaelsen, 17). 

The arrangements of the gonads and their funnels m the 
 higher families is thus obtained simply by the disappearance of 
 the posterior pairs of testes and ovaries respectively ; and the 
 arrangement of the spermathecae— in the Megascolecidje at any 
 rate— is arrived at by the disappearance of the anterior of the 
 three pairs of the ancestral form (the anterior pair of sperma- 
 thecge would correspond, as already explained, to the posterior 
 pair of male openings). The primary position of the spermathecss 
 in the Glossoscolecida} and Lumbricida;_ is, as has just been 
 indicated, scarcely ascertained with precision. 

The occurrence, in existing earthworms, of gonads or of traces 
 of gonads, in the segments in which, on the present theory, they 
 are supposed to have existed regularly in the ancestor, confirms 
 the view here taken. Woodward (28) has shown that m the 
 common English species the presence of additional pairs of 
 ovaries in segment xiv is much commoner than has been 
 supposed, and that additional testes are not rare. There are 
 also cases where the supernumerary ovaries are not limited to 
 one pair; Woodward (27) examined a specimen with seven 

pairs. 

Confining ourselves, however, to cases where the condition is 
 definitely that of the presumed ancestor— one extra pair of 
 ovaries in segment xiv— we ha,ve the following records :— Bergh 
 (quoted by Woodward) described three cases in species of Tmm- . 
 bricus. Woodward's own investigation shows nine cases of this 
 condition out of fifty worms examined. Beddard, in an 
 examination of a number of specimens of Perionyx excavaius (1),
