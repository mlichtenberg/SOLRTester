476 DR. J. WATERSTON ON A NEW 

Antenna: length 1'25 mm. (see text-fig. 1), consisting of scape, 
 pedicel ring joint, five normal funicular joints and a large 
 sausage-like clu)> (consisting of two funicular and three normal 
 club segments fused). 

Moutli parts. — Labrum (3:2) Avith convex edge and five stout 
 fringing bristles of which the longest equals the breadth of the 
 sclerite. Mandible (4 : 3) bidentate, the upper tooth smaller 
 and rather abruptly and obliquely truncated superiorly. Stipes 
 smooth, about a dozen bristles. Max. palp, (measured along 
 outside edge) 11, 12, 15, 36. In same ratio the breadth of 
 joints 1-3 is about 10 and of 4, 15. •Terminal bristles of 4th 
 about half the length of that joint which bears also 10 stout 
 bristles on apical half and about 20 finer more generally distri- 
 buted. Labial palpus 15, 9, 15 with a breadth at the joints of 
 12-14. Apical bristles distinctly longer than third joint which 
 bears also about a dozen other bristles mainly stout. There are 
 no fewer than 10 (5 : 5) setigerous cells on the lingua. 

Thorax. — Pronotum, in two separate rhomboidal sclerites each 
 with the inner anterior angle rounded off". The outer anterior 
 angle is weakly chitinized. The postero-lateral angle is folded 
 down enclosing the spiracle. Each sclerite bears (mainly on the 
 posterior half) about 50 stifli" bristles of which 6-8 stand along 
 the hind margin between the mid line and the spiracle. Pro- 
 sternum, bristles (8-9 : 8-9). Pro thoracic surface generally 
 nearly smooth, duller and raised reticulate at the sides in front of 
 the spiracle. Mesonotum very broad, only a little longer (7 : 6) 
 than wide, divided almost equally by the transverse suture, the 
 scutellum and axillte being relatively large. Parapsidal furrows 
 deep, mid lobe (measured with the prothorax removed) just 
 longer than the scutellum. The intercept of the parapsidal 
 furrows on the transverse suture (4 times the narrow base of 
 the scutellum) occupies rather over one-third of the breadth. 
 The pattern on the mid lobe is moderately coarse and raised ; 
 of the parapsides and axillae a little lower, while the scutellum is 
 nearly smooth with over 40 bristles equally distributed about 
 a bare mid line. Before the suture the surface is densely bristly 
 and there are about a dozen on each axilla. These notal bristles 
 are a little longer posteriorly with six (3 : 3) above the hind 
 edge of the scutellum distinctly stronger than the others. 

Metathorax. — All over finely reticulate, pattern hardl}^ raised, 
 the three regions well defined. Mid area posteriorly crenulate, 
 lateral areas with one bristle each. 

Propodeon smooth with strong reflections, contoured as in text- 
 fig. 1, shortly rugose i^ound the insertion of the petiole. With a 
 delicate percurrent mid line but no keel. Spiracle facing 
 anteriorly and outwards, only the edge of the peritreme visible 
 from above. There are about 15 bristles behind and beyond 
 the spiracle. 

Mesosternopleuraa nearly all smooth, the only indications of a 
 raised pattern being on the prepectus (posterior half) and in
