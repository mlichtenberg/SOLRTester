56 DR. W. RAE SHERRIFFS ON EVOLUTION 

with Henderson's description and figure. Tlie supporting bundle 
 is moderately developed and lias about 3 projecting spindles, 
 one of them slightly longer than the othei's. The projecting 
 portion is about a third of a millimetre in length. 

7. Other spicules. What is most cha- 
 racteristic of this specimen and Hender- Text-fig. 15. 
 son's is the appearance of many of the 
 stalk spicules. They are spindles straight 
 aiTid curved, spindles approa'ching clubs 
 and very rough at the broad end, irre- 
 gular bodies and many quadriradiates, 
 all marked by the length and strength 
 of their spines and protuberances, which 
 are sometimes compound and often tu- 
 berculate. Some of the curved spindles 
 have these prominent processes especially 
 strong about the middle, while others 
 are veiy markedly unilateral, with a few 
 tubercles on one side and a great array j>. mirahiUs Heud. 
 of long, often divaricate processes on the 

other. These unilateral processes are strongest at one end of 
 the spicule and wane towai-ds the other. Among the extra- 
 ordinaiy forms, which present an appearance unusual in the 
 genus, there are commonplace straight spindles with small regular 
 spines and tubercles. 

Localities : — Stations 99 and 282. 

9. Dendronephthya flammea (sp. n.). 

Diagnosis : — Divaricate ; outline quite irregular ; markedly 
 flattened ; lower branches somewhat foliaceous ; polyps in small 
 branches of 3-6, but many isolated polyps occur ; polyp stalks 
 very short ; supporting bundle strong ; point spicules one strong 
 pair ; crown of 4-5 rows of straight rough spindles ; grade VI. ; 
 spicules : sterile stalk has large rough yellowish spindles along 
 with small red interlocking forms ; no spicules found in the 
 canal-walls ; colour : brilliant red as a whole, spicules of the 
 branches and twigs deep red. 

Anthocodial Grade and Formula : — 

VI. = 2 P + 3-4 Or + strong S.B. 

Descriptive Notes : — 

1. Colony as a whole. Two colonies, the larger measuring 
 17 cm. in height, including the 3"5 cm. sterile stalk, by 10 cm. 
 in breadth. 

2. Branching. Divaricate, quite irregular in contour, markedly 
 flattened. The lower branches are somewhat foliaceous, but do 
 not form a collar. It ought to be referred to the cervicornis group 
 of Kiikenthars Divaricatse and to the subdivision with short 
 polyp stalks ; but it does not agree with any of the three species
