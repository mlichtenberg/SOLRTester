siibequal, 2 being set a little more foi-vvanls than 5. The inter- 
 digital webbing, however, does not perhaps extend so far distally 
 as in Hystrix, and the soles are — in part, at all events — covered 
 with squaniiform papillae instead of being smooth. The plantar 
 pad of the fore foot seems to be of much the same form as in 
 Hjjstriv, and just behind it and in contact with i't there is an 
 immense carpal pad with a median depression indicating its 
 division into the two normal elements. The plantar pad of the 
 hind foot is reduced to three smooth isolated prominences rising 
 from the papillate integument ; and the metatarsal area shows no 
 trace of the two pads, but is uniformly papillate in its distal 
 portion, where it is scarcely defined from the plantar portion, 
 and smooth and swollen in its proximal portion up to the heel.

In Octodon degas the fore foot is artiodactyle, the third and 
 fourth digits being paired and subequal and a little longer than 
 the second and fifth, which are also subequal, the fifth, however, 
 being a little the shorter of the two. These four digits ai'e stout, 
 shortish, with sharp moderateh^ long claws; the pollex is quite 
 short and i-epi-esented externally by little more than its claw. 
 The plantar pad is large, as wide as the foot, considerably wider 
 than long and markedly three-lobed, the median lobe being larger 
 than either of the others. It is covered with papillae, which 
 spread on to the base of the digits, and each lobe is provided with 
 a single large papilla opposite the three interdigital spaces. The 
 double carpal pad of which the two elements ai'e mesially in con- 
 tact, the outer being a little the larger, is a little larger than the 
 plantar pad and, like it, covered with papillae, with a single 
 enlarged papilla at the antero-external corner of each. Behind 
 this pad there is a naked triangular area of skin. (Text-fig. 9, B.) 

In general features the hind foot is like the fore foot, but the 
 digits ai-e much longer and the plantar pad narrower and the 
 hallux is relativ^ely much longer than the pollex. There is a, 
 single enlarged circular papilla opposite the four interdigital 
 spaces, and two others on the metatarsal area, one set forwards 
 on the ulnar side just behind the outer moiety of the plantar pad 
 and the other farther back on the radial side some distance 
 behind the papilla opposite the space in front of the hallux. Th.e 
 whole plaiita.r surface is covei'ed with small papillae, except the 
 heel, which is naked ; and there is a median groove defining the 
 two elements of the metatarsal pads. I regard the feet of 
 Octodon as the most generalised type found in the Hystricoraorph 
 Rodents. (Text-fig.''9, A.) 

Winges figures of the feet of sevei'al genera of Lonchei'inae 
 {LoncJieres, Echimys, Trichomys (jYelomys), Carterodon, Mesomys) 
 show that, with variations in detail, they conform tolerably closely 
 with those of Octodon degios. They are pentadactyle with greatly 
 reduced pollex and short hallux ; the primary interdigital ele- 
 ments of the plantar pads are separated, but they are rela- 
 tively much larger than in Octodon, and the papillate areas of
