 lion (text-fig. 8, c.g). Tlie latter ends in a large ganglion whence 
 two nerves emerge. One joins the lateral division and the other 
 becomes the gangliated cord of the sympathetic. In the thorax 
 it gives branches to the aortic plexus (A.P) and a long branch runs 
 to the cceliac ganglion. The latei-al division of the cord, and the 
 coeliac branch of its mesial half constitute splanchnic nerves 
 (Sp.N).

The abdominal part of the left sympathetic (text-figs. 7 and 8) 
 possesses four ganglia. It gives off two groups of lateral branches 
 to the semilunar ganglion, i-ami communicantes to the lumbar 
 nerves, and branches to the aortic plexus. It has a great ten- 
 dency to subdivision. 

The thoracic part of the right sympathetic (text-fig. 8, R.s) has 
 few ganglia in the anterior part, and its postei'ior part is very 
 complicated, but not so much as the left cord. It divides into 
 mesial and lateral parts and these are united at intervals by 
 common ganglia or communicating branches. The lateral 
 division ultimately continues the cord back to the sacrum. The 
 mesial division is thick and strons;. Branches of the cord run to
