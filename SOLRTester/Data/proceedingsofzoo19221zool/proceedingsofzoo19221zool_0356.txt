above that touching the tops of the rear median and front 
 laterals. 

The lip is as broad as long, slightly hollowed in front, I'ounded 
 at the sides, and narrowed at the base. It hardly reaches to one- 
 half the height of the maxillse. The latter are convex, upright, 
 rounded on the outer side,, the anterior margin furnished with 
 thick heavy fringes. 

The sternum is a broad shield -shape, convex, narrowed in front, 
 rounded at the sides, and, rather finely pointed at the rear, it 
 terminates in front of the rear coxfe. The legs are modeiately 
 stout, with five pairs of spines under tibia i. and ii. and three 
 pairs under metatarsus i. and ii. 

The tarsi have thick claw-tufts, no scopulas, but rather thick 
 bristles, along tarsus iv. The claws are well curved, stout, with 
 three teeth near the base. 

The abdomen is ovate, broadest posteriorly, with a broad 
 pedicule, visible from above ; the surface is smooth, with only 
 scattered hairs and bristles. The inferior spinnerets are short 
 and conical, broad at the base, with a hemispherical 2nd joint. 
 The superior are similar, but much smaller still, rather wide 
 apart, standing behind the outer margin of the inferior.

I have described this non-adult female from Dran, Langbian 
 Mountains as a new species only. The position of the lateral 
 eyes of the front row, as far to the rear as the tops of the rear 
 median, was L. Koch's grounds for constituting his genus 
 Pycnoctenns and removing a single species from Walckenaer's 
 genus of Ctenus. In the narrowness of the clypeus, however, 
 the above-described differs from both genera. The shape of the 
 cephalothorax and abdomen agrees with L. Koch's genus, but I 
 am unable to distinguish any third claw, and in his the lip is 
 manifestly more than half as long as the maxillse, while here it 
 is the opposite. 

I therefore leave it as a Ctenus, in spite of the narrow clypeus 
 and the front laterals, because it follows that genus in too many 
 other points.
