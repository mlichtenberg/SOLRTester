there is no true crown, but there are small white spindles on the 
 soft polyp stalk, lying irregularly but on the whole transversely 
 and quite distinct from the coloured spindles of the supporting 
 sheath which lie longitudinally. It is plain that the uppermost 
 rows of these transverse spindles might furnish the raw materials 
 of a crown. 

The supporting bundle is of the ensheathing type and is often 
 very inconspicuous. The typical form is a curved triangle 
 around the polyp stalk, composed altogether of about a dozen 
 spicules, and those composing the tip are not conspicuously longer 
 than the rest. It is what might be called a slightly difierentiated 
 supporting sheath rather than a, supporting bundle, and its 
 comparatively small spindles must not be mixed up with the 
 large supports of the common stalk of the common bundle. The 
 supporting bundle oi:ily occasionally projects a little beyond 
 the polyp. Its component spicules do not attain a length of 
 more than 0*75 mm. 

7. Other sjncules. Very noteworthy is the spiculation of the 
 short, sterile stalk, where for a veiy limited area the spindles are 
 replaced by irregularly branched, almost stellate, bodies, which 
 interlock and give the surface an arenaceous appearance. Many 
 of the branchlet spindles are striking in their size, reaching a 
 length of 6 mm. They are densely covered with truncated 
 columnar tubercles which form regular curved transverse rows, 
 recalling the septa, of an elongated Fungia coral. The truncated 
 tops are very rough and sometimes compound. 

The colourless spindles of the general cortex are partly like 
 small editions of those just mentioned, and partly narrower forms 
 with distant and relatively few tubercles. They range from 
 l-2"5mm. The small "stellate" forms at the base are very 
 irregular in shape. Many are almost globular ; many are minute 
 quadriradiates ; many show one predominant boss among the 
 radiating knobs ; wdiile many again correspond exactly with those 
 figured by Kiikenthal for D. japonica (fig. L 6)*. 

Very few canal-wall spicules could be found. Those that 
 occurred very spai-ingly were narrow rodlets with a few distinct 
 tubercles. 

Deduction : â€” Although this splendid specimen has no uniform 
 contour it presents many resemblances to D. hrevirama (Burch.), 
 such as : 

(1) the anthocodial armature of 6-8 spicules in each point, the 

uppermost not projecting ; 

(2) the short polyp stalk ; 

(3) the numerous 2 mm. spindles of the general cortex ; 

(4) the crowded stellate bodies of the lower cortex ; 

(5) in the polyp - bearing twigs a corymbose - dichotomous 

branching, almost identical with that of specimens which 
 agree in detail with D. hreviraifna.
