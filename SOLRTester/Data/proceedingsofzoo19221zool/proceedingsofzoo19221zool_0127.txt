between its jaws. Also, in my tumblers, the beetles immediately 
 became very active when a piece of worm was quietly dropped in, 
 even when they could not see it, and they would at once begin to 
 hunt round until they found it. 

3 (b) Longevity of imago in artificial environvient. 

In some of my tumblers I kept pairs, in others single indi- 
 viduals, each tumbler being supplied with a small piece of 
 water-weed, usually Modea^ and also with a few pebbles to give 
 foothold. The water was changed dail}^ or on alternate days, 
 according to circumstances, and 1 had no difficulty in keeping 
 the beetles alive for months and even for more than a year in 
 this way. Deaths that occurred were almost always among the 
 pairs, and the male succumbed more frequently than the female. 
 Presumably the cause of death in these cases was overcrowding, 
 six or seven ounces of water, even when changed daily, not being 
 sufficient for two individuals. 

I had previously experienced this difficulty in keeping several 
 individuals of a species in a confined space. For instance, 
 Hydrohius fascipes L., a smaller beetle than PeloUus, lived much 
 lono-er when one was kept in each tumbler than when two or 
 three were so kept. Of twelve individuals of such a small species 
 as Bidessits miautissimus Germ, only six sui-vived after a month, 
 two after three months, and one shortly after that, the last 
 survivor living for many months. At the same time six indi- 
 viduals of this same species, each in a separate tumbler, survived 
 for periods varying from one to three years, the water in these 
 tumblers never being changed, only a little being added from 
 time to time to make up loss due to evaporation. 

I have mentioned that, in the case of Pelobius, when one pair 
 was confined in a tumbler the male usually died first, Avhich 
 suo-o-ests that the male is not so hardy as the female. Experiments 
 showed that the female lives longer than the male. As I was 
 unable to find the details of about a dozen experiments carried 
 out in 1913— before the work described in this paper was com- 
 menced—I set aside four tumblers in May 1920, each containing 
 much decaying leaf material rich in Ghironomus larvte and various 
 other forms of life. In each tumbler I placed one Pelohius, using 
 for the experiment two males and two females. A small piece 
 of Eloiea was placed in each tumbler to keep the water fresh, and 
 each tumbler was covered with a piece of glass to reduce evapo- 
 ration. Nothing was done to these tumblers until May 1921, 
 by which time, out of the six ounces of water originally placed 
 in each of them, only about three remained. The two females 
 were^ alive but both the males were dead.

 PeloUus used to be sold in St. Martin's Lane, London, under 
 the name of the " Squeak beetle," owing to its being able to
