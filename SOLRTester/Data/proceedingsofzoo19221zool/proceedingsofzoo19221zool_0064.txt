32 ON ANIMAL COMMUNITIES IN THE SOUTHERN NOllTH SKA. 

according to the friendly communication of Dr. Rassell, have 
 been taken with the bottom sampler this year on the Dogger Bank. 

As to the number of animals per square mile, it will be seen from 
 the accompanying list (pp. 28-29) that, setting aside the Epi-Fauna, 
 we have to do with a comparatively poor fauna. For instance, the 
 â€¢' Fewts "-stations together give only 26-3 gr. per 2-6 sq. m. or 
 lO'l gr. per sq. ra. But on the other hand, most of the animals 
 are useful as being excellent fish-food. Compared with the 
 " Fe?^^ts "-community in the Kattegat (Rept. XXI., Appendix, 
 pp. 9-13), it will be seen that the apparent richness of the latter 
 is due mainly to big echinoderms such as Echinocardmm and 
 Ophiiirids, or big lamellibranchs such as Cyprina or Aiacoma 
 calcarea, useless as fish-food. 

On the other hand, we may find in the North Sea as well as in 
 the Kattegat small areas within the " Fe?iws "-community, in- 
 habited by large numbers of Mactra suhtruncata (see, for instance, 
 St. 8 in Rept. XXL, Appendix, p. 65, with over 2 kg. per sq. m,, 
 also among the samples taken by the ' George Bligh ' this year 
 on the Dogger Bank, several of which contain some hundreds of 
 speciinens per 0*2 sq. m.). It would be of the greatest interest 
 to know something further about the distribution and abundance 
 of this most important food species, at different times of the year 
 and at different places in the North Sea. At the same time 
 continued investigation of the stomach-content of the food-fishes 
 is called for, following up the excellent work of Todd (Second 
 Report on the Food of Fishes, North Sea Investigation Committee, 
 Southern Area, Second Report, Part I., 1904-5). From his 
 paper it would appear that the food of the fish in the south- 
 western North Sea is composed mainly of " Venus "-animals. 
 But, as mentioned above, we have in the deeper central parts of 
 the North Sea an extended area, which is still a terra incognita 
 and still awaits charting.
