ANATOMY OF THE DRILL. 443 

them and their prominent vertebral branches. In most mammals 
 the Annnlus, when present, surrounds only the subclavians. 

Intercostal ai'teries: — The upper two spaces on each side are 
 supplied by the superior intercostal branch of the subclavian 
 artery, and the internal mammary artery. The third, fourth, 
 fifth, and sixth left spaces are supplied by the intercostal arteries 
 from the aortic arch and the internal mammary artery. The 
 lower six left spaces are supplied by intercostal branches of the 
 descending aorta and the musculo-phrenic arteries. The right 
 spaces from the third to the twelfth are supplied by intercostal 
 branches of the descending aorta, internal mammary and musculo- 
 phrenic arteries. The internal mammary artery gives off a large 
 branch along the anterior rib, and a thin one along the posterior 
 rib bounding each space supplied by it. 

The aortic intercostal arteries are arranged as in those 
 Primates possessing thirteen pairs of ribs. 

The ahdominal aorta gives off branches in the following 
 order : — Inferior phrenics, cQ?liac axis, splenics, superior mesen- 
 teries, renals, spermatics, inferior mesenteric. At intervals it 
 gives off four pairs of lumbar arteries. The first left lumbar artery 
 passes postero-laterally as an ilio-lumbar artery. The aorta ends 
 by dividing into two common iliac arteries, and does not give off 
 a middle sacral (caudal) artei"y. Lateral sacral branches of the 
 hypogastrics form the caudal artery which passes through chevron 
 bones. 

2'he Veins. 

The inferior labial veins (text-fig. 18, I.P.Y) unite to form 
 a long superficial trunk which opens into the superficial temporal 
 vein (S.T.V) ; and the latter drains the frontal, temporal and 
 orbital regions, and the upper lip. The inferior labial vein com- 
 municates with the mylo-hyoid veins which drain the muscles 
 and the tongue. The mylo-hyoid trunk (M.H.V) divides into 
 two. One part enters the internal jugular vein (l.J.V), and the 
 other unites with a vessel formed by the internal maxillary 
 (I.M.V) and deep facial (D.F.V) veins. And the resulting 
 vessel opens into the internal jugular vein. The arrangements 
 and relations of these veins are shown in text-figs. 

The external jugular vein (E.J.Y) is formed on the surface of 
 the sterno-mastoid miiscle by the union of superficial temporal 
 and infeiior labial veins. It has the usual course through 
 the neck, and unites with the subclavian vein to form the in- 
 nominate vein. The internal jugular vein (I.J.Y) drains the 
 thyroid gland, and opens into the innominate vein. 

The left innominate vein cvoa&es the anterior part of the thorax 
 obliquely and unites with the more vertical right innominate 
 vein to form the superior vena cava. The latter receives the 
 vena azygos major in the usual way and ends in the antei'ior 
 part of the right auricular appendix. 

The intrathoracic part of the inferior vena cava is short.
