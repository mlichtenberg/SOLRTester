WITHIN THE Gh;NUS DENDROXEPIITHTA. 63 

Locality : — Station 99. 

A second eolon^^ the lai-ger and flattened from side to side, 
 may also be refei'red to D. collaris. Here the polyparinm is very 
 markedly transverse oval. There is no hint of any projection 
 from the anthocodial points (whicli consists of 5-6 pairs en 
 chevron), and the lower cortex shows, among other forms, 
 numerous flattened, spindle-shaped, triradiate, boomerang-like, 
 and irregular spicules, which have not been noticed in the other 
 colonies studied. Yery marked also are the length and strength 
 of the prongs arising from some of the curved spindles, pseudo 
 clubs, and irregular multiradiate bodies. 

Deduction : — If one disregards the detail of growth on which 
 Kiikenthal partly bases the group collaris, namely that the 
 hemispherical bunches are quite supei-ficial, one should place 
 D. collaris close beside D. hahereri, which has more, though 
 similar, spicules in its anthocodial points and a different kind of 
 spiculation on the cortex of the sterile stalk. 

14. Dendronephthya longicaiilis (Kiik.). 

Described by Kiikenthal in ' Versuch einer Revision der 
 Alcyonarien,' ii. pp. 633-634 (1905). 

Diagnosis: — Umbellate; very long stalked ; somewhat flattened 
 polyparinm ; basal branches foliaceous and form a collar ; polyps 
 in small, loose umbellate groups ; polyp stalks usually short, but 
 may reach 2 mm. long; supporting bundle weak; point spicules 
 one pair only, one of which is stronger; crown of 4-6 ; grade YI.; 
 spicules : cortex of the branches covered with stout spindles 
 bluntly tuberculate, cortex of the stalk with many stellate forms ; 
 colour : general cortex has the surface pink- white, pol}p-stalks 
 red-brown, anthocodial spicules almost translucent. 

Anthocodial Grade and Formula : — 

YI. = I -h 1 P -F 4-6 Cr + weak S.B. 
 Descriptive Notes : — 

1. Colony as a lohole. A single, peculiar specimen unlike any 
 other in the collection ; marked by a long flexible stalk (10 cm. 
 out of a total of 13) ; of uniform diameter (1-3 cm.) ; and bearing 
 a rather loose umbellate polyparinm, somewhat flattened. 

2. Branching. The basal branches of the polypai-ium ai^e 
 foliaceous and form a collar turned downwai-ds. There are but 
 few branches extending transversely, so that the top of the 
 polyparinm appears rather truncate. 

3. Colouring. General surface of the cortex is pinkish white, 
 the polyp stalks reddish brown, while the anthocodial spicules 
 are almost translucent. 

4. Polyp stalks are on an average about 1 mm. long, but a 
 length of 2 mm. maybe attained. They appear to be bare on 
 the ventral side. 

5. Polyps. The bundles of polyps are disposed in small loose
