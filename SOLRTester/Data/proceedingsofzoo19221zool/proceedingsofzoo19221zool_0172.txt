126 DU. J. STEPHENSON ON THE MORPHOLOGY, CLASSIFICATION, 

segm. X. Each is a short, thick cylinder, with a soft, white 
 lobulated surface and a central canal opening on the surface in 
 groove 10/11. 

The outermost coat is by far the most bulky ; it is composed 
 of large cells (jjrost.) with distinct outlines, the cytoplasm of 
 which stains moderately with haematoxylin. The cell substance 
 is in general granular, the nuclei (mtc.) are small, homogeneous, 
 of various shapes, often peripherally situated, and do not stain 
 much more deeply than the cytoplasm. In one specimen there 
 are numerous vacuoles [x.) in the cells, each with a small, round, 
 homogeneous, lightly staining mass in the centre. 

In thickness this layer is 120 /x or ' more. The cells do not 
 pierce the muscular and connective-tissue layers to join the 
 epithelial lining of the prostatic lumen; some cells are sessile on 
 the muscular layer, others have their rounded inner ends slightly 
 separated from it (c/. fig. .3). There can, I think, be no real 
 doubt that the layer of large cells is not a bursting of the lining 
 epithelium through the muscular coat. 

Outside this layer there is often to be seen a peritoneal coat 
 as a very thin blue-staining membrane — a mere line — with here 
 and there more or less flattened nuclei, often -apparently 
 degenerate. In some cases the membrane spans the angle 
 between the outer ends of neighbouring cells. Sometimes a few 
 muscular fibres may be seen outside the layer of large cells. 
 The peritoneal layer may also carry blood-vessels of considerable 
 size, some branches of which penetrate the layer of large cells. 

From what are the cells of this layer derived ? The presence 
 of a peritoneal layer surrounding them would seem to preclude 
 the possibility of their being themselves peritoneal in origin, as I 
 at first supposed ; while the fact that they are totally cut off 
 from the lining epithelium — separated from it by the muscular 
 layer — seems to shut out the possibility of referring them to the 
 epithelial layer. 

I believe that they are peritoneal in origin, however ; the fact 
 tliat they are covered in places by a flattened peritoneal epi- 
 thelium does not necessarily negative this view. A peritoneal 
 membrane persists over the layer of large cells in the same way 
 that such a membrane persists over the lobes of the testes in 
 species of Lumhricillus : the testes are proliferations of the 
 coelomic epithelium, which in this genus (as in Ocnerodrilus) are 
 .covered in at first by a delicate peritoneal membrane. 

(4) The Vas Deferens. 

The vas deferens descends from the testis sac to the ventral 
 body-wall, and in doing so forms a number of coils on both sides 
 of septum 9/10. In this part of its course its diameter is about 
 40 /x ; its lining epithelium consists of cells staining pink with 
 eosin, which almost occlude the lumen and whose nuclei are 
 situated below the middle of their height ; Ifc possesses also a
