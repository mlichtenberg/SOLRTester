Descriptive Notes :— 

1 . Colony as a ivhole. Ten specimens of a peculiar form, the 
 smallest 15 mm. in height, the largest 17 cm. Tliey are remark- 
 able in showing, especially in the larger forms, a great bare gap 
 between the collar and the loosely glomerate polyp-bearing area. 
 In the largest specimen this interval extends for about 6 cm. 
 Here and elsewhere it is extremely limp, and it looks as if the 
 polyp-bearing area had rested on the mud: in the upper part of 
 the colony there are numerous galls due to and containing small 
 Balanidfe, and the polyps are very muddy. It should be noted as 
 a feature that the upper part of the polyparium is distinctly top- 
 heavy; in the largest specimen it has a breadth of 10 cm., 
 whereas the stalk bearing it is only 1 cm. across. The colony 
 broadens again at the very foliaceous collar and measures 6 cm. 
 from side to side. Below that the sterile stalk, which is markedly 
 flattened, measures 3'5 cm. in breadth. There are numerous 
 stolons. 

2. Branching. The three largest spe- 
 cimens show two lateral short branches Text-fio* 7 
 arising immediately above the collar, 
 but not affecting the bareness of the gap 
 alluded to. 

3. Colouring. The twigs and polyp 
 stalks bear red spicules ; the anthocodial 
 armature is whitish or transparent ; the 
 general cortex is yellowish ; the collar is 

" of a very conspicuous red ; the sterile 
 stalk has the same colour as the general 
 cortex. 

4. Polyp stalks and their spicules. 
 The length of the polyp stalks is very 
 great — often reaching 3 mm. in the 
 collar and about 1*5 mm. in the upper 
 polyparium. The spicules are red and B. clavata Kiik. 
 very thorny. 

5. Polyps. 
 branches. 

6. Polyp spicules. The anthocodial architecture is primitive, 
 having 7 or 8 pairs of very uniform short rod-like spindles in 
 each point and no distinct crown. The supporting bundle is 

* In the anthocodial fonnulne the point spicules are denoted by " P " if big and 
 strong, and by " p " if small and weak; the crown spicules b}^ " Cr," and the supporting 
 bundle by " S.B." preceded hy a qualifying adjective (c/. page 43).
