(1) A splendid old bull with very massive horns, 58" long and 

10|" I'ound their base. 

(2) A very big adult bull, with horns still groAving and traces 

of tan on the top of the loins. 

(3) An adult cow that had probably given birth to several 

calves. 

In conclusion, one is glad to remark that there is no reason 
 why this splendid Antelope should not continue long to exist in 
 its present environment. During three months spent in the 
 locality I must have seen at least 100 individuals, forming 
 several strong and flourishing herds, and measures have been 
 taken by the Portuguese Government, at the instigation of 
 Mr. Yarian, to protect them. 

The local native name is " Sumbakoloko."

On comparing a number of skins of this Antelope from various 
 localities as far as Lat. 10° S., which is approximately the limit of 
 its known range, it is difficult to arrive at any positive con- 
 clusions. In the B. M. collection the skins from South Africa, 
 Zululand, the Transvaal, and Southern Mozambique are greyer. 
 A skin from IST.E. Rhodesia and a series collected in Angola are 
 more fulvous. The most pronounced fulvous skins are two 
 collected by the Rudd Expedition — one from near Beira, and the 
 other from Gorongoza District in P. E. Africa. A paler and 
 greyer race has been described by Lord Rothschild (P. Z. S. 1907, 
 p. 237) from Fort Jackson in IST. Rhodesia. The Nyasaland race 

* This measurement is taten by holding the foreleg perpendicularly under the 
 animal, forcing it into the shoulder and then measui-ing from heel to top of withers. 
 This method would give a mean height. The shoulder height of the animal when 
 alive would probably give 1" more. 

t -B. arundinum occur in the Bahr-el-Ghazal Province of the .Sudan in the 
 neighbourhood of Dud Majok, N.E. of "Wau. Along the Meshra-er-Rek-Wau road 
 and westwards along all the tributaries of the Bahr-el-Ghazal River a small Bohor 
 Reedbuck is common.
