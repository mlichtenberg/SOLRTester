6 Hens. Two of these were coloured all over ; three had the 
 pile coloration, i. e. featheis laced with fawn colour on the back, 
 the breast and abdomen uniform pale brown ; one was white, with

5. Pile lacing rather pale ; legs pink. 

6. White with trace of reddish lacing on neck ; legs pink. 

B. Offspring of cock with slightly yellow back, and hens white 
 with black specks. 

8 Cocks. One of these was a moderately coloured pile ; six were 
 pale or very pale piles; and one was not a proper pile, but had 
 spots of orange and black on wings, hackles, and tail. Four of 
 them had yellow legs and four had pink legs. 

9 Hens. Two of these were typical piles, with pale back laced 
 with fawn colour and brown breast, one rather more deeply 
 coloured thaiT the other. One was reddish brown all over with 
 black specks. The rest, six in number, were white with scattered 
 specks of colour, and two of them had a yellowish tinge on head 
 and neck-hackles. I give below the notes for each of these 
 individually : — 

4. White with minute specks of black. 

5. Yellow on head and hackle ; back and tail with many black 

spots. 

6. Yellow on head and hackle ; black specks on back. 

7. White with a few grey marks on feathers. 

8. Yery slight specks of black here and there ; othei wise 

white. 

9. Y^hite with few black spots. 

Five of these hens had pink legs and four had yellow legs. 

I have not paid special attention to the inheritance of the 
 colour of the legs in this experiment, but will merely point out; 
 the leg colours noted in the F„ generation. Yellow leg means 
 yellow skin, and what I have called pink leg means white skin. 
 The yellow skin was a character of the White Leghorn hens of 
 the parents in the cross, the white skin a character of the Black-
