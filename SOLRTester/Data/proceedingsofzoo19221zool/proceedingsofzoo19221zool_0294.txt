Excretory pore. — The excretory pore is '47 mm. from the head 
 end. 

Genital organs. — Male : The convoluted testis reaches within 
 3 mm. of the head end and is irregularly coiled. The vesicula 
 seminalis is spindle-shaped, lying in the long axis of the body. 
 The cement gland is very long, measuring 3'5 mm. 

Female : The irregularly convoluted ovaries reach within 3 mm. 
 of the head. The divergent two uteri lie side by side for most 
 of their course. Each ends in a strong muscular ovejector 
 which lies, in the case of the anterior uterus, cephalad and, in 
 the case of the posterior uterus, caudad of the vagina. The latter 
 is a short horizontal duct joining both uteri to the vulva. The 
 opening of the vulva is not surrounded by raised lips, and is 
 placed 2"17 mm. cephalad of the anus.

Quilonia uganda Ivhalil. Lateral view of bursa. 

Bursa. — Seen from the lateral aspect the bursa has a spindle 
 shape, lying obliquely to the longitudinal axis of the body. The 
 dorsal lobe is slightly longer than the lateral lobes and has a 
 rounded end. The ventral, lateral and externo-dorsal i-ays con- 
 form to the general design in the genus, but are all more slender. 
 The dorsal ray is long and thin, being "5 mm. in length. It 
 bifurcates in its lower third into two long and slender branches. 
 These in their turn branch nearer their ends. The most lateral 
 ray arises first, and the two medial lays arise by a common trunk 
 branching lower still. This airangement is exactly the opposite 
 of that in Q. apiensis. 

^v. The pre-bursal papillae are placed "52 mm. from the tip of the 
 bursa. 

Genital cone. — This cone is placed nearer the ventral than the 
 dorsal surface. Its tip is rounded. The cloacal opening is
