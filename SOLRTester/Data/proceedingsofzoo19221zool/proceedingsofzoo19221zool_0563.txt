ZOOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF LONDON. 

LIST OF PUBLICATIONS. 

The scientific publications of the Zoological Society of London 
 are of two kinds â€” " Proceedings/' published in an octavo 
 form, and '' Transactions/' in quarto. 

According to the present arrangements, the " Proceedings'' 
 contain not only notices of all business transacted at the scien- 
 tific meetings, but also all the papers read at such meetings 
 and recommended to be published in the "Proceedings" by 
 the Committee of Publication. A large number of coloured 
 plates and engravings are issued in the volumes of the 
 " Proceedings/' to illustrate the new or otherwise remark- 
 able species of animals described therein. Amongst such 
 illustrations, figures of the new or rare species acquired in a 
 living state for the Society's Gardens are often given. 

The "Proceedings" for each year are issued in four parts, 
 paged consecutively, during the months of March, June, 
 September, and December, From January 1901 they have 
 been issued as two half-yearly volumes, indexed separately. 

An " Abstract of the Proceedings " is published by the 
 Society on the Tuesday following the date of the Scientific 
 Meeting to which it refers. It is issued along with the " Pro- 
 ceedings," free of extra charge, to all Fellows who subscribe to 
 the Publications, but it may be obtained on the day of publi- 
 cation at the price of Sixpence, or, if desired, sent post free 
 for the sura of Six Shillings per annum, payable in advance. 
 The " Transactions " contain such of the communications 
 made to the Scientific Meetings of the Society as, on account of 
 the nature of the plates required to illustrate them, are better 
 adapted for publication in the quarto form. They are issued 
 at irregular intervals. 

Fellows and Corresponding Members, upon payment of 
 a Subscription of One Guinea before the day of the Anni- 
 versary Meeting, are entitled to receive the Society's 
 Publications for tlie year. They are likewise entitled to 
 purchase the Publications of the Society at 25 per cent, less 
 than the price charged to the Public. A further reduction 
 of 25 per cent, is made upon purchases of Publications 
 issued prior to 1881, if they exceed the value of Five 
 Pounds. 

Fellows also have the privilege of subscribing to the 
 Zoological Record for a sum of Two Pounds Ten Shillings 
 (which includes cost of delivery), payable on the 1st of July 
 in each year ; but this privilege is forfeited unless the 
 subscription be paid before the 1st of December following. 

The following is a complete list of the publications of the 
 Society already issued.
