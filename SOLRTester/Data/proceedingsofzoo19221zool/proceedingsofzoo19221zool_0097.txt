6. Polyp sjHcules. The aiithocodial armature of 8-10 pairs of 
 white spicules, closely opposed en chevron with no more than a 
 hint of projection, is the salient feature 

of the colony. Owing to their white Text-fig. 17. 

colour these spicules stand out very 

conspicuously. Their surface is covered 

irregularly with minute tubercles, which 

are much more crowded towards the 

tips. 

The supporting bundle is strongly 
 developed, its largest spicules projecting 
 for 0*75 mm. 

7. Other spicules. The stem has 
 loosely disposed spindles, many of them 
 having only minute and rather distant 
 spinules. These tend to be slender. 
 Those of the surface of the sterile stalk -D. klunzingeri Stud. 
 show a stronger development of thorns. 

There are, besides spindles, many irregular triradiates, quadri- 
 radiates, and brackets. 

Kiikenthal lays stress on the great reduction of the sterile 
 stalk. This is far from the case in this specimen, where it 
 occupies 1*5 cm. out of a total height of 4 cm. From what I 
 have seen in other cases, I do not think that the proportion of 
 stalk to polyparium is of much importance. 

Kiikenthal also notes that the outermost polyps bore markedly 
 projecting spicules at the tips of the points. Of this feature this 
 specimen shows no more than a trace ; but on account of the 
 characteristic anthocodial armature, I cannot separate it from 
 D. kluvzingeri.
