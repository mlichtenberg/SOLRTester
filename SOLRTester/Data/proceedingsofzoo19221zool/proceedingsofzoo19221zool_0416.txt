It is desirable to know to wliat extent the difierences illustrated 
 by his classification are to be found in other features of the 
 respiratory system. 

In order to test this I have examined the respiratory oi'gans 
 of the following forms, all of which are represented in the 
 material available in the Zoological J)epartment of the British 
 Museum : — - 

1. JIarisa cormt-arieits (Trinidad). 

2. Am/jyullaria i^ermiformis (Pernambuco). 

3. ,, glauca (Demerara). 

4. ,, ins'ularum (South America, ? loc). 

5. Lauistes afflnls (Victoria Falls). 

6. ,, olivieri (Egypt). 

7. Pachylabra sp. (Sikkim). 

8. „ sp. (Perak). 

9. ,, gordoni (Victoria ISTyanza,). 

According toBouvierand Fischer (3) Lanistes is less specialized 
 for siphonal respiration than Amjndlaria. The siphon is short 
 and does not appear to form a complete tube. On coming to the 
 surface of the water it apparently places its respiratory orifice 
 in direct communication with the air, and the siphon is not an 
 indispensable part of the mechanism. A. {=Pachylahra)glcmca,to 
 judge from Ramanan's account, represents a more advanced con- 
 dition, but not yet approximating to Ampullaria s. s. There 
 is true siphonal respiration and apparently, as in the South 
 American -vermiforinis, the base of the siphon assists in closing 
 the left hand side of the pallial aperture. But the siphon is very 
 short, its orifice very broad, and there is no i)umping-movement 
 of the head such as Bavay and others have described for South 
 American forms and as Miss Cheesman and I have witnessed in 
 A, vermiformis. We finally have complete siphonal breathing in 
 AonpuUaria s. s. achieved by a very long flexible siphon. 

In Ampullaria and Marisa there is a rather small and sub- 
 circular or ovoid respiratory orifice situated on the anterior end 
 of the lung-cavity rather towards the left. Its edges are some- 
 times thickened slightly and tend to overlap each other. It is 
 difficult to see whether closure is effected by a sphincter or by the 
 overlapping edges. 

In the two Asiatic species examined and in P. gordoni from 
 East Africa a very different condition is found. The respiratory 
 aperture is large and gaping, and is not a simple orifice in the 
 floor of the lung. Genei'ally found more in the middle of the 
 latter, it extends backwards a.nd to the right — as far as the right- 
 hand wall of the- pulmonai-y cavity — as a wide longitudinal slit 
 l)etween two maikedly overlapping edges, the inferior of which 
 (left-hand) is inserted into the floor of the pallial cavity. 

In Lanistes the orifice occupies more or less the same position 
 as in Ainpidlaria, i.e. anterior, to the left and close to the osphra- 
 dium. It shows, however, the same general structure as in
