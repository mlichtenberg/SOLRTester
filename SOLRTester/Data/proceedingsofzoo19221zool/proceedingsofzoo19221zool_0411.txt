A Xote on the Blue Buck (Cephalophus melanorheus). 

At the Loanda Zoological Gardens were a male and female 
 Blue Buck in a large paddock. The general colour of this pair 
 was ash-grey with patches of a rusty tinge, The latter may have 
 been due to a seasonal change of coat or to conditions of 
 captivity. 

Description. — Head darker than body. Rump not noticeably 
 darker than body. Legs ash-brown. Tail fringed with white 
 hairs, with the base and centre black. 

This pair, which appeared to be rutting, were following one 
 another about the enclosure, and were seen repeatedly to face one 
 another and rub the facial suborbital glands together, with a 
 stropping action, continued repeatedly, first on one side and then 
 on the other.
