&2 MR. F. BALFOUR-BROWNE ON THE LIFE-UISTORY 

The mechanism of all this complex apparatus seems to be as 
 follows : — The Pelohius larva pounces upon tlie Titbifex and, by 
 expanding the oesophagus, sucks the end of the worm into the 
 stomodfeum, and the mandibles then close so that the prey is held 
 either between the two, or more usually, between the upper and 
 the epipharynx. I think, therefore, that it usually passes into 
 the mouth between the two lobes of the epipharynx {v. PI. I. 
 figs. 11 & 12). 

At the moment of seizing upon the worm the maxillfe and 
 labium are shot forward and the prey is received into the "scoop,' 
 and these parts then retract, the flap in the "scoop"' pressing 
 the worm upwards into the epipharyngeal slit, and the closing 
 of the jaws bending the body of the worm upwards so that it 
 is completely jammed and cannot move backwards or forwards 
 {v. PL I. fig. 12). At the first suck, the end of the worm pre- 
 sumably reaches well down into the pro-ventricular mill, where 
 it is well bruised, and, when this portion has been sufficiently 
 crushed, the hold upon the worm is momentarily relaxed by the 
 opening of the jaws and the shooting forward of the maxillfe and 
 labium ; the sucking action is repeated, and once again the mouth- 
 parts jam the body until another section has been crushed by 
 the pro-ventricular mill. 

4 (g) Habits of the fidl-groimi Larva. 

The larva is full-fed about twenty-two days after the second 
 moult, by which time it measures about 15 mm. in length, the 
 median " tail " adding another 5 mm., and it is now ready to 
 leave the water. In my tumblers it was always evident when 
 this stage was reached, because the larva would swim round and 
 round at the surface and endeavour to climb up the glass. 

As I wished to watch the work of the larva in forming its 
 pupal cell in the earth, I tried, with this species, the same 
 method as I had used successfully with Dytisctis lajjponicus — that 
 is, I placed the larvse in an earth-bottomed vivarium with a glass 
 side, made an artificial burrow in the ea,rth against the glass, and 
 carefully directed the steps of the larva, to the entrance of the 
 burrow, closing the mouth of the latter when the larva had 
 entered. With this species, however, the method did not work 
 so successfully, as the larva, having reached the end of the 
 artificial burrow, usually continued it on its own account and as 
 a rule in a direction away from the glass. Digging up such larvfe 
 and starting them again seemed to discourage them, and they 
 were a.pt to sulk and make no cell at all. 

I therefore devised a special glass cell consisting of two lantern- 
 slide cover-glasses. Between these two, at adjacent corners, two 
 small pieces of cork, half an inch thick, were placed so that, along 
 one side, these two plates could not come into contact. Along the 
 opposite side the two plates were brought into contact and held
