376 MR. tt. I. POCOCK ON THE EXTERNAL 

The only genus of the group which has genuine cheek-pouches 
 is Cadogenys; Init near the edge of the cheek, just inside the 
 mouth, in CJiiiichilla I find a small integumental pocket on each 
 side. These do not seem large enough for the storage of food, 
 and I am unable to surmise what their function m;iy be. (Text- 
 fig. 4, E.) 

The cheek-pouches in Codogenys lie on each side of the maxillary 
 portions of the palate, mainly in front of the molar teeth, and are 
 associated with the well-known and unique structural peculiarity 
 of the skull from which the genus takes its name. The outer 
 wall of each pouch is the original skin of the cheek, which 
 infeiiorly passes downwards on to the face behind the corner of 
 the mouth. But this wall is entirely concealed from view 
 externally by the skin-covered, arched, laminate outgrowth of 
 the maxillary portion of the zygoma, which curves downwards 
 below the level of the palate and the molar teeth ; and this 
 lamina itself forms the outer wall of a hair-lined external cheek- 
 pouch the orifice of which lies on the face above and behind the 
 angle of the mouth. Thus the original wall of the cheek, 
 covered with hair externally and with moist mucous membrane 
 internally, forms a partition between the internal and external 
 cheek-pouches; aiid this partition, being pliable, can be thrust 
 by pressure from inside the mouth so as to bulge into the cavity 
 of the outer cheek-pouch so as to diminish its size and increase 
 to a corresponding degree the size of the internal cheek-pouch. 
 If the latter were packed full of food, the external pouch would 
 be practically obliterated ; but there would be no visible swelling 
 on the face, such as is seen in the case of monkeys, hamsters, and 
 other mammals provided with these food-receptacles, because of 
 the presence of the secondary cheek formed by the bony out- 
 growth of the zygomatic arch. (Text-fig. 5, A, B.) 

There can, I think, be no doubt that the internal cheek-pouches 
 are used for storing food, although I have never found any food 
 in them in dead specimens of Coelogenys. I attach no import- 
 ance, however, to this negative piece of evidence, because the 
 pouches of monkeys aie usually empty when they die. That the 
 external cheek-pouches are not used for storing food is also, in 
 my opinion, beyond doubt, because the fore feet of Ccelogenys are, 
 judging from tlieir structure, altogether unsuitable for thrusting 
 food into them. 

From the description above given, it will be evident that the 
 laminate expansion of the tnaxilla acts as an external shield to 
 the cheek-pouch when distended. But this affords no expla- 
 nation of the equally remarkable expansion of the jugal portion 
 of the zygomatic arch behind the cheek-pouch. 

Tke Ear. 

The ear in Hystrix and Atlierura is comparatively small, but 
 stands well up from the head with a tolerably evenly rounded
