B. To tlie left lialf of the plexus : — 

1. Superior mesenteric plexus (s.m.p). 

2. Aortic plexus (p). 

3. Left renal plexus (o). 

4. Phrenic plexus (I). 

5. Communicating to left vagus (c.l.v). 

The arrangement differs, therefore, from that in Tanmndua. 

Tatusia novemcincta (text-fig. 5). 

The Vagus Nerves : — Both ganglia nodosa are present, and 
 communicating branches run to the supei-ior cervical ganglion of 
 the sympathetic and other cranial nerves in its vicinity ; and the 
 branch to the spinal accessory is very prominent {c.s.a). The 
 pharyngeal branch (a) resembles that in Eaphractus. No 
 branches run to the sympathetic trunk.

The vagus and sympathetic in Tatusia novemcincta. A. Upper cervical part ; 
 B : posterior thoracic and abdominal parts of the vagi. Description in 
 text. 

The supetHor laryngeal nerve (b) forms a loop which commu- 
 nicates with the sympathetic cord distal to the superior cervical 
 ganglion ; but no vascular nerves run upwards from it, as in 
 Euphractus. No lingual branch of the vagus is present as in 
 Tamandua. 

The Cardiac Plexuses have the usual mode of formation, but 
 the superficial one has no Ganglion of Wrisberg. 

In the posterior part of the thorax the left vagus divides into 
 two. One branch runs along the dorsal aspect of the oesophagus, 
 communicates with the coeliac plexus and ends on the dorsal 
 gastric wall. The other branch runs along the ventral aspect of 
 the cesophagus, communicates with the right vagus and ends on
