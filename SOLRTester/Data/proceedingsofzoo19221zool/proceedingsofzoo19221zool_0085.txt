1. Colony as a whole. Two handsome orange- coloured colonies, 
 the largest 28 cm. wide and 20 cm. high, eight others smaller 
 ill size. 

2. Branching. Markedl_y glomerate. Tiie numerous rounded, 
 polyp-bearing, boss-like masses predominate over the stem and 
 main branches. Therefore the colonies must be included in 
 Kiikenthal's hempriclii group. The lowest branches of the colony 
 show slight foliation. 

3. Colouring. Generally deep orange-coloured polyps and 
 white cortex. The colony from station 240, however, showed 
 quite a. difiereut colour-scheme, viz. bright red spindles in the 
 supporting bundle and anthocodise, bat the general cortex greyish 
 with opaque, white, almost porcella,nous spindles. 

4. Polyp stalks and their spictUes. Short, under 1 mm. 

5. Foli/ps. Densely arranged in very characteristic plump hemi- 
 spherical masses of 7 or so. 

6. Polyp spicules. ' The anthocodial arcliitecture without enter- 
 ing into details, may be noted as having the 8 points often elon- 
 gated with the tips meeting above the polyp. Another feature 
 is the practical absence of any true crown. Kiikenthal notes in 
 his definition of D. yigantea that each of the 8 points has 5-6 
 pairs of spicules, the uppermost much larger than the others and 
 ma.rkedly projecting. It is easy enough to find on the specimens 
 anthocodise which exactl}' correspond with this description.

Yet on the same colony may be found points with 5, 4, 3, or 
 2 pairs, and finally even a single pair, abutting a,gainst a few 
 transitional small spindles leading on to the supporting bundle. 

Great care was taken to avoid damaged or disturbed antho- 
 codiae, and the annexed diagrams show a series of frequently 
 recurring types of architecture. 

A general feature may be noted that in the great majority of 
 cases the two uppermost predominate, and that when the number
