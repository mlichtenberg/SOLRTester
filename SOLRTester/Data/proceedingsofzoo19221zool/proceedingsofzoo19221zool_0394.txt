322 MR. G, BLAINE ON THE ZEBRAS 

The herds of Sable at tliis period of the year, viz. September 
 to December, do not move about a great deal, and it was possible 
 to walk a long distance of 8 or 10 miles through the forest 
 without crossing a single fresh track, and yet within the circle so 
 described two or three lierds might be harbouring. As referred 
 to above, they confined themselves to certain sections of fcjrest 
 which could always be recognized b}^ the kind of trees of which it 
 was composed, and the art of finding the Sable was a question of 
 keeping within the limits of these trees. 

Unless distui'bed a herd remains in that section in which it hns 
 established its feeding and resting quarters. Grazing through 
 the early morning till about 9 a.m., it wanders ofi' to a denser 
 patch, whei'e it rests till about 3 p.m., the whole herd lying down 
 rather scattered and often without a sentry. 

No concise information relating to the breeding habits was ob- 
 tainable, but no small calves were noticed running in the herds, 
 and as the big bulls were all with the cows, it might be inferred 
 that the autumn is the rutting season. One afternoon I had a herd 
 under observation in some thick forest, and noticed the old bull 
 apparently taking stock of his cows. He rounded them up one 
 by one, driving each to the front, and then turned back to fetch 
 another. His methods were rather autocratic, for he i-an at the 
 cow and butted her behind with the front of his horns if she was 
 at all inclined to loiter. Having passed them all in review, he 
 followed sedately in rear of his protegees. 

The big bull is generally somewhere in the background, that is 
 to windward, and it is difficult to see him â€” black among black 
 shadows and the lattice of black tree-trunks. He spends a great 
 deal of his time lying down, but often a great pair of curving horns 
 rising directly above the undergrowth discloses his position. The 
 brilliant chestnut cows, on the other hand, easily catch the eye. 
 At intervals one or another, generally a young one, gets on its 
 legs and begins to graze, and then lies down again on the same 
 spot. At length all i-ise together as by a preconcerted signal, and 
 wander oft' slowly grazing. 

Their drinking habits were not noted, but as sufficient water 
 was always obtainable from pools in the stream-beds in the high 
 forest, it is probable that they drink regularly. They did not 
 appear to go down to the Luando to drink. 

The bulls have a habit of rubbing their great horns on the bark 
 of saplings and small trees, the branches of which they break oft". 
 This action imparts to the horns a red tan colour, very beautiful 
 in contrast with the velvety blackness of the skin. They also, 
 after soiling, invariably scratch with their hind feet, inore cants, 
 cutting long grooves in the earth. The rubbed bark, broken 
 branches, and sapling tops hanging head downwards from the 
 stem by a strip of bark, together with furrows scratched in the 
 soil, are a certain indication establishing the presence of Sable in 
 distinction from Roan Antelope. The latter occasionally go 
 through the same performance of scratching, but not so regularly
