process. If Gaupp's observation be confirmed, the ossifications 
 must be regarded, I think, as the paired centres of the true 
 basisphenoid. In fact, if one looks at the basisphenoid of an 
 embryo lizard with its huge median fontanelle (cf. text-fig. 5), 
 it is difficult to see how it could be ossified except by lateral 
 ossifications if it is not completely ossified by invasion from the 
 pai-asphenoid. 

The other suggestion made by Watson, that the meniscus 
 pterygoideus found in Sphenodon by Howes and Swinnerton and 
 previously figured by Parker in the lizard is the homologue of 
 the little bones in '•'■ Seymouria^^ seems to me manifestly the 
 correct one.

The palate of the primitive Tetvapod Conodectes favosus Co-pe= Seiymouria

 others this is a very primitive reptile : the writer favours the view that it is a 
 highly developed Embolomerous Amphibian. 

Watson as made up of parasphenoid in front and basisphenoid 
 behind. Though I have not seen the specimens, I incline to 
 think it probable that the whole will prove to be parasphenoid 
 or vomer. But, in any case, there seems to me no doubt that the 
 little intercalated element is the homologue of the little one 
 we have in the lizard and Sphenodon. 

When we go further down in the scale we have hitherto had 
 difficulties, as no good palate was known of any of the Rhipidistian
