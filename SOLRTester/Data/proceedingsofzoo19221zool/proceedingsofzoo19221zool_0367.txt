SPIDERS FROM SOUTH AXNAM. 311 

The sternum is ovate, widest in the middle, longer than bi'oad, 
 tapering to rear and front, where it is truncate the width of the 
 base of the lip. 

The coxre on each side are contiguous, as are also the rear 
 pair. 

The tibial joiiit of the palpi is longer than the patella. There 
 is no apophysis at the base of the distal joint, which holds a 
 simple oval convex bulb with only a short tiagellum. 

The legs are moderately long, the femoral joint of tlie first 
 pair thicker and more club-shaped than the others. 

There are three pairs of spines under tibia i., one long pair at 
 the base of metatarsus i., and a single spine on the inner side 
 near the distal end. 

The two tarsal claws have a few teeth at the basal end, covered 
 by claw-tufts of thick fla.t bristles. On riictatarsi iii. and iv. 
 are one single and two pairs of long spines with a bunch at th& 
 distal end. A pair of spines on the patella of the same, none on 
 the femur. 

The abdomen is ovate, rounded in front, rather pointed at the 
 rear. The texture is soft, with flat lanceolate bristles on the 
 upper side and fine short simple hairs on the under side and a 
 bunch of bristles at the base. 

The measurements in millimetres are as follows : â€”

A single male from Dran, Langbian Mountains, S. Annam, 
 3000 ft., would appear to come nearest to M. Simon's African 
 genus of Tame, but it is clearly necessary to place it in a new 
 genus, on account of the difference given above. 

I would like to record an observation m^ade by an esteemed 
 correspondent, Mr, H. C. Abraham, an oiiicer of the Govern- 
 ment Survey Department at Taiping, F.M.S. 

Ml'. Abraham, who is an enthusiastic arachnologist, was 
 watching a female of the Giant Orb Weaver, Kephila maculata, 
 on her web, running about on which were three of the minute
