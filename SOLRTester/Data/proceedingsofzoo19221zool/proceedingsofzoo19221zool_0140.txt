96 MR. F. BALFOUR-BROWNE ON THE LIFE-HISTORY 

EXPLANATION OP THE PLATES. 
 Plate I. 

Figs. 1-5. Colouv-pattenis of Velohius larvfe. Figs. 1 and 2 are taken from lavvie 
 near the end of their first stage, and figs. 3, 4, and 5 from larvae in their 
 third stage. The specimens were merely selecced to show the range of 
 pattern, there being no noticeable difference in different stages of the 
 same larva. 

Fig. 6. Diagram of alimentarj' canal of a Pelohius larva to show proportionate 
 lengths of Stomodieum (S), Proctodaeum (P),. and mid-gut (MG). 

Fig. 7. The egg of PeJobius 24 to 36 hoiirs old. The embryo has begun to appear. 
 Note the large head-lobes, the first signs of the neural canal and the 
 post, end submerged in the yolk, which, at this stage, is not segmented. 

Fig. 8. The embryo about 3 days old (in Ji\ne when incubation lasts only 9 or 10 
 days), showing the appendages appearing, the antennae between the head- 
 lobes and the first abdominal appendages, the last of the series at this 
 particular stage. The yolk is now segmented and the amnion is 
 completely formed. 

Fig. 9. The embryo 4 to 5 days old (in June) ; the amnion still intact. The first 
 abdominal appendages very large and distinct. The depressions at the 
 sides of the thorax and first abdominal segments are, presumabh', the 
 commencements of tracheal-tube formation, though the fact that there 
 is no prothoracic spiracle perhaps makes this doubtful. 

Fig. 10. The embryo 7 or 8 days old (in Jiine). The ej'es have just developed, the 
 membranes have ruptured, rolled back, and disappeared within the dorsal 
 region of the embryo. The first abdominal appendages are now smaller. 

Fig. 11. Front view of head of a third-stage larva to show the relative positions of 
 parts. CL = ('lypeus. LBR=the labral ridge, beneath which are the 
 two epipharyngeal lobes, EP. F is the " fiap " standing up in the 
 "scoop" of the labium, LAB. LAB.P=lal)ial palp. Mx=maxilla, 
 sunk in its base. Mx.P = Maxillar3' palp. M=Mentum. (JU=Gular 
 sclerite of head capsule. ANT = Antenna. 0=Ocelli. MDB = Mandibles 
 which are in a position for seizing the prey. 

Fig. 12. Front view of head as in fig. 11, except that a worm is in the mouth 
 and the mandibles have closed upon it. This diagram shows how the 
 worm is bent upwards hv the mandibles and thus jammed so that it 
 cannot move backwards or forwards. 

Plate II. 

Fig. 1. Mouth-parts of a third-stage larva with labvuni, epipharynx, and "roof" 
 of uiouth removed to show the relative positions of labium (LAB), 
 maxilla (Mx), fully extended, and mandibles (Mdb). S = the " scoop " fully 
 extended and F, the " flap " in the " scoop." Mxl possiblj^ represents the 
 niaxilluhe. Hyp, a dark chitinous plate in the floor of the mouth just 
 where it narrows to the " gullet," presumably represents the hypopharynx. 
 Note the four holes in this plate which seem to be always present. 

Fig. 2. Labium and maxilla as in fig. 1, but with the " scoop " fully retracted and 
 the maxillte almost fuUj^ retracted within their bases. 

F'ig. 3. Ventral view of labium and maxillai, .showing the " scoop " fully extended 
 and one maxilla extended and the other fully retracted within its base. 
 M=mentum, not clearly marked off from the bases of the maxillae, but 
 recognizable. G=the gular sclerite. 

Fig. 4. Ventral view of labium as before, but with the scoop fullj^ retracted. It 
 will be seen therefore that the scoop telescopes into the rest of the labium 
 just as the maxillas do into their bases. 

Figs. 5 & 6. Views of the pro-ventricular spines of a third-stage larva, in situ, 
 showing the backvvardlj' directed " teeth " and hairs on the inner faces. 
 Fig. 5 is a view from above and fig. 6 is a lateral view. These two 
 figures are from camera lucida drawings, and the millimetie scale 
 indicates their magnification.
