MEXDELIAN EXPERIMEXTS ON FOWLS. 355 

here we have one black, one grey, and one reddish brown. The 
 recessive character therefore appears in different degrees in 
 different individuals, and the fact that the black hen has some 
 Avhite on its feathers shows that the segregation is not complete 
 and the recessive character not perfectly puie. 

The pile birds, both cocks and hens, were soon after Oct. 9th 
 separated from the rest, and on Nov. 20th I examined the hens 
 which were not pile, in order to satisfy myself whether there 
 were any pure dominants, i. e. white without specks of colour. 
 Of Lot A there were none without some lacing to the feathers, as 
 seen from the observations of Oct. 9th, given above. Of the six in 
 Lot B which were not deeply coloured nor pile, there was not one 
 without some trace of colour. Three of them showed slight 
 lacing of colour on the neck-feathers, and all except one of these 
 had a few black or grey specks. 

According to these results, then, thei^ewere no pure dominants 
 either in Lot A or Lot B of the F, generation. Two hens in 
 Lot A had ver}^ pale lacing. In the cocks of this lot there were 
 all degrees of intensity in the red coloui- of the pile. In Lot B 
 there was one cock which was not a proper pile, but had spots of 
 orange and black on its back, and six hens with either a trace of 
 lacing or some specks of colour. If these six hens in Lot B are 
 to be regarded as pure dominants, we have six ont of 17 or nearly 
 one in three instead of one in four. This may seem a good 
 approximation to the theoretical proportion, but it is unlikely 
 that .all the dominants should be female. The fact, however, is 
 that none of these birds w^ere without evidence of colour, and 
 therefore it cannot be said that there Avas complete and clear-cut 
 segregation. 

As I was unable to make mnny further experiments with these 
 birds of the F., generation, I decided to mate some of the hens 
 with least colour with another black-red cock to see if they 
 behaved as heterozygotes or as pure dominants. Accordingly 
 two of the F^ hens above described with least traces of colour 
 were mated in March 1921 with a hankiva (black-red) cock which 
 was among the birds at that time alive in the Zoological Gardens. 
 From this mating nine offspring were produced and reared. As 
 there were traces of colour in the female parents, and some of the 
 Fj hens were also wdiite with black ticks, I thought it possible 
 that these F,, hens would behave as heterozygotes, and not as pure 
 dominants. I therefore i-ather expected that half the chicks 
 would develop into piles and half into black-reds. All the nine 
 chicks obtained, however, developed in mature plumage into fairly 
 typical piles. There were five cocks and four hens, onl}^ one 
 cock and one hen having somewhat paler colour than the rest. 

Although the number of chicks obtained is small, I am of 
 opinion that the Fâ€ž hens behaved genetically as dominant: if they 
 had behaved as heterozygotes, I think there would have been at 
 least one, and probably more than one, black-red among the 
 offspring, the theoretical explanation being, of course, half the
