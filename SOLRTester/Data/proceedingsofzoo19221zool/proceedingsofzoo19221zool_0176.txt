lined by a layer of cubical epithelium, modified as follows in 
 certain regions : — 

(1) The funnel — a long, rather curved groove on the posterior 
 wall, extending from the roof of the chamber downwards to the 
 beginning of the oviduct. The cells composing it ai-e high and 
 narrow, with much elongated nuclei situated above the ixiiddle of 
 the height of the cells ; the cytoplasm is granular ; the free 
 surface is bordered by a layer of rodlets (" Stiibchen "). 

(2) The ovary, on the anterior wall, consisting of a number of 
 finger-like lobes attached along an oblique area on each side of 
 the alimentary canal ; the upper portion of this area is quite 
 narrow, but it gradually widens below. 

(3) Various proliferations of small cells, with deeply staining 
 nuclei ; these constitute somewhat indefinite heaps which do not 
 seem to be on the way to develop into ova, since the characters 
 of the cells are the same at the periphery of the mass as deeply 
 in its substance. These masses occur on both anterior and pos- 
 terior walls (one is cut dorsal to the gut on the posterior wall of 
 the chamber in the figure), and also at various places within the 
 ovisacs. 

In another specimen the ovisac was largely filled by pinkish- 
 yellow (yolk) granules, amongst which nuclei were occasionally 
 seen, and a few of the small cells mentioned above. A thick 
 layer of the grains replaces the coat of prolifei^ating cells on the 
 inner surface of the wall of the ovisac. In the chamber and 
 ovisacs there may be numerous small yellow masses like those in 
 the testis sacs ; these frequently have a number of dark granules 
 within them. 

(6) The Sperinathecce. 

The spermathecal apparatus in the genus consists of a spherical 
 or ovoid ampulla, attached to the hinder surface of septum 7/8, 
 and communicating with the exterior by a long, coiling duct; the 
 duct leads downwards on the septum, and ends in an atrial 
 chamber which debouches to the exterior in the intersegmental 
 fissure. The atrium is the variable part of the apparatus ; it may 
 be of considerable size, and either simple in form, projecting to 
 one side or other of the septum where this joins the ventral 
 pai-ietes; or bifid, one horn projecting on one side and one on the 
 other side of the septum ; or it may be small — even invisible in 
 dissection, owing to its being embedded in the body-wall ; or 
 possibly, in some cases, it may be altogether absent. 

In the present species the ampulla consists of the usual coats. 
 The lining epithelium is shortly columnar over the vault of the 
 sac and away from the origin of the duct, and the nuclei are 
 round ; it is high, and may be very high, on the lower part of the 
 sac near the origin of the duct, and on the anterior wall, and the 
 nuclei are correspondingly elongated. All the cells are provided 
 with rather short cilia. Embedded in the much elongated 
 epithelium at one part of the wall was a quantity of bright yellow
