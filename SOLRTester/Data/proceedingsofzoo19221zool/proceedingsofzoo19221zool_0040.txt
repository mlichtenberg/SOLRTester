which makes it vahial:»le for reims. Thei'e are, however, a good 
 number of the common species in the Southern Reserve, and one 
 can frequently see a herd from the mail train on the Uganda 
 Railway near Sultan Hamud Station. 

Wildebeest. — In former times there were vast numbers of 
 these beasts to be seen, and in the spring of 1896 I saw an 
 ■enormous herd, which I estimated at nearly 10,000 head, migrating 
 northwards along the Athi Valley on the east side of Avhere Athi 
 River Station now stands. The species is, however, in no danger 
 of extinction, for there are still a considerable number in the 
 Southern Reserve and on the Loita Plains. 

I will now add a few words regarding the vagaries of 
 geographical distribution of some of our game species, and the 
 difficulty of ascertaining the laws that govern it. 

I will give the following examples : — 

1. Sable Antelope. — This species is found from the border of 
 Tanganj'ika Territory near the coast and inland for about 20 
 miles, then very sparsely northwards to the Sabaki River, where 
 it ceases. In fact, it is extremely rare noi'th of the Uganda 
 Railway. It is not found anywhere else in Kenya Colony or 
 Uganda. 

2. Wildebeest. — In the plains near Kilimanjaro through the 
 Southern Reserve up to the neighbourhood of Donyo Sabuk this 
 abounds ; it stops abruptly at the Thika River. Farther west it 
 is found to a small extent in the southern portion of the Rift 
 Valley, but never extended northwards along that valley farther 
 than the Lower Kedong Yalley, although the plains immediately 
 to the north abounded in grass and water. West of the railway 
 the wildebeest favours the Loita, Plains ; in that area, however, it 
 was shut off from extension to the north by the Man Forest. 

3. RoAX. — Tlie distribution of this antelope is very capricious. 
 It is said to be sporadically foiuid near the coast, but is very rare, 
 and I have never seen it there. It is foxmd on the big range of 
 lulls west of Sultan Hamud, and on the foot-hills of the Ukamba 
 Range to the east of that place. Then there is apparently a gap, 
 for I have not heard of its occurrence again until we come to the 
 Nyando Valley about 30 miles east of Kisumu. Sir Frederick 
 Jackson also mentions its occurrence near the Turkweli River. 
 It is, however, nowhere a common beast. Odd specimens may 
 yet turn up in unexpected places. 

4. Topi. DamaUscus senegalensis. — The distribution of this 
 antelope is Avorthy of attention. On the coast it is fairly common 
 between j\Ialindi and Lamu, and some say that it is found farther 
 south near Vanga. Jackson states that it does not occur south of 
 the Sabaki, but I saw a few 2n.AV. of Rabai. Proceeding inland
