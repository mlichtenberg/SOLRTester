The (pncilis {text-i\g. 13) fuses with sartorins at its insertion, 
 and the coiul)ined muscles are inserted along one-tliird of the 
 length of the ventral border of the tibia. 

The adductor- longu.s (text-fig. 13) has n loi)g attachment to 
 the femur, and its distal limit is about half an inch above the 
 internal condyle. 

The adductor magmis (text-fig. 13) is a long, narrow muscle 
 whose tendon is attached to the npper end of the tibia. 

The great sciatic nerve divides at the bottom of the triangle 
 formed on the inner aspect of the thigh by the sartorius, gracilis, 
 and adductor longus. 

The anterior crural nerve divides into two main branches in 
 Scarpa's Triangle. 

The external cutaneous nerve breaks up into a number of 
 branches over the quadriceps, and communicates with the anterior 
 erui'al nerve. 

The quadriceps extensor is inserted into both condyles of the 
 femur and upper border of the patella, and the ligamentum 
 patellas is attached to the tibia over a length of two inches. At 
 the lower limit of the latter is the long strip of attachment of 
 the sartorius and gracilis. The vastus internus component is 
 extremely powerful. 

The glutei have coarse, thick fibres, but they are not voluminous 
 as in Man. The gluteus medius is much thicker than the 
 maximus. 

The levator ani is a very stong, thick muscle, but the jjyri- 
 formis is very long, thin,, and slender. It cannot be employed in 
 subdividing the structures passing from the pelvis to the thigh 
 as in Man. 

The great sciatic nerve gives ofi" a very thick cord to the ham- 
 strings after it winds beyond the femoral trochanter. These 
 muscles are inserted into the upper half of the dorso-lateral 
 boi'der of the tibia. 

The gluteus minimus and lateral rotators of the thigh form a 
 thick fan-shaped muscle, with many tendinous fibres originating 
 alonÂ£c the entire vertical len<i:th of the ilium. 

The Alimentary Canal. 

Heshy lips are connected to the gums by well-marked frenums, 
 but no labial tubercles are present. 

The oral vcstihtde is smooth and has well -developed cheek- 
 pouches. 

The hard palate is crossed by twelve pairs of incomplete ridges 
 radiating from the mid-line, but there is no prominent median 
 raphe, and no incisive })ad ; the ridges become more curved on 
 the posterior part of the palate, and those of the last two pairs 
 are sinuous. 

The soft palate has a, well-marked uvula.
