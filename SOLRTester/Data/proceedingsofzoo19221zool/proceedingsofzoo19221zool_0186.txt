140 DR, J. STEPHENSON ON THE MORPHOLOGY, CLASSIFICATION, 

Since, therefore, the criteria for estimating the numbering of 
 the segments in the anterior part of the body of Destnogaster 
 allow of results of only doubtful value, I believe we are justified 
 in taking a numbering which corresponds — allowing for the 
 evolution described above — with that of the other genera of the 
 family. In any case, if subsequent investigations, directed 
 specially tovvards this point, should show that the accepted 
 numbering is correct, I should, prefer to account for it by 
 assuming an increase in the number of segments in the anterior 
 part of Desmogaster after the stocks of Ewpolygaster and Draioida 
 had been given off, rather than by an independently produced 
 elimination of a segment, or a dislocation forwards of all the 
 organs, in these two genera. 

The following figures show the relations of the three genera ;
