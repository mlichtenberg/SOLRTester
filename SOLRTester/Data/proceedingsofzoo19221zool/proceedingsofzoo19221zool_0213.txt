CICHLID FISHES OF LAKE VICTORIA. 159 

species, with a lai'ger mouth and more prominent lower jaw ; in 
 some species of this group the mouth is oblique, and in some the 
 outer teeth are strong and spaced. Finally, there are species 
 with a strongly projecting lower jaw, in some of which the cleft 
 of the mouth is nearly vertical. 

One species, R. ishmaeli, is of peculiar interest ; it is so like 
 H. cinereus that the types (12 specimens) include 6 examples of 
 the latter, but it differs in having much larger and more massive 
 pharyngeals, with the teeth large and blunt, whei'eas in H. cinereus 
 they are small and slender. I have described a similar pair of 
 species (//. tetrastigma and H.-placodon) from Nyassa. A remark- 
 able group of three species includes Haplocliromis sauvagei and 
 the monotypic genera Macroplexirodus and Hoplotilapia, which 
 scarcely differ from each other except for the considerable differ- 
 ences in dentition, and seem to illustrate Cope's paradoxical 
 view that a species may persist through several genera. It is 
 especially interesting to note that the normal markings are those 
 described above as characteristic of many Victoria species, but 
 that in addition all three are known to possess a " hicolor" form, 
 a sort of piebald, in which the dark pigment is concentrated into 
 a number of blotches and irregular ci'oss-bars which extend on to 
 the vertical fins. 

Another interesting example of the same species in different 
 genera is provided by Hcqylochromis annectens and Plaiytceniodus 
 degeni ; here the former shows a slight departure from the 
 normal Hci'plochromis dentition towards the Platijtceniodus type. 

The conclusion is that in Victoria most of the endemic 
 Cichlidfe have evolved in the lake from a t^'pe very similar to 
 Haplochromis cinereus, and that the primary evolution has been 
 in the size and shape of the mouth, and the number, structure, 
 and arrangement of the teeth, doubtless in adaptation to different 
 kinds of food and different methods of feeding. The facts seem 
 more in harmony Avith Gulick's theory of habitudinal segregation 
 than with the modern idea of evolution by accidental mutations. 
 The Cichlidee of Tanganj'ika and JSTyassa lead to the same 
 conclusion. 

In my paper on the Nyassa Oichlidse I called attention to two 
 striking examples of convei-gent evolution, Pseudotropheus and 
 Aulonocara of Nyassa, respectively showing a gi-eat resemblance 
 to Tropheus and Trematocara of Tanganyika. Lake Victoria 
 provides some more examples : Haploclirornis chilotes has the lips 
 thick and produced into lobes as in Lohochilotes of Tanganyika ; 
 M. ishmaeli has the pharyngeals massive and provided with large 
 blunt teeth as in H. placodon of Nyassa. Further, Haplochromis 
 ohliquidens and Macropleurodus bear a resemblance to Nyassa 
 genera in their dentition, the former to Heinitilap)ia, the latter 
 to Cliilotilapia. 

If the degree of differentiation be taken as a guide, one may 
 form the conclusion that the Cichlidte have inhabited Tanganyika 
 longer than Nyassa, and Nyassa longer than Victoria.
