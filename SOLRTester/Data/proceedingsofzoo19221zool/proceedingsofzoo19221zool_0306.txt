apiensis, iiganda, and ethiopica the external leaf-crown projects. 
 In Q. ethiopica particularly the shape of its leaflets is so distinctive 
 as to form a specific difierence. In Q. traii/vacra, africana, and 
 brevicauda the external leaf -crown is more or less hidden by the 
 mouth collar. 

Table II. gives in detail the vai-ious measurements useful in 
 difiei'entiating any species of Quilonia. The data for Quilonia 
 renniei and tranvacra are taken from Lane. The data for the 
 rest of the species are based on my pei'sonal examinations. The 
 numbers are given in millimetres. 

Genus Pteridophakynx Lane, 1921. 

Body is slender, with discoidal head. The rays of the external 
 leaf-crown vary in length. The oral cavity has the shape of an 
 inverted funnel, its cuticular lining coming into contact Avith the 
 circular chitinous ring which forms the oi'al capsule. The 
 (esophagus is short and wide. The internal aspect of the three 
 cesophageal columns may or may not be sculptured in a plumose 
 fashion. When this is present, the free intei'nal surface of the 
 oesophagus is moulded into a number of freely projecting ridges 
 which run obliquely outwards and posteriorly, giving it a 
 feathered appearance. 

In the male bursa the lateral ray has a prominence or acces- 
 sory i^ay on its posterior border, while of the three branches of 
 each dorsal ray the two outer are fused partly or to nearly their 
 tips. The spicules are equal and similar, and an accessory piece 
 is present. 

The vulva lies closely anterior to the anus, the vagina running 
 anteriorly aiid dividing into two parallel anteriorly directed uteri, 
 each provided with axi ovejecfcor. 

Type-species, Pteridopharynx africana Lane, 1921. 

Pteridophakynx africana Lane, 1921. 

Very little needs to be added to the description given by Lane. 
 The leaflets of the external leaf-crown are sixteen in number. 
 There ai'C two teeth projecting into the floor of the mouth capsule, 
 apparently regarded by Lane as the beginning of an oesophageal 
 funnel. The dorsal ray of the bursa before its final division 
 has an irregular outline. In some specimens this has the shape 
 of one or two processes, but this feature is not constant. Lane 
 did not see ova in any of his female specimens. I am able to 
 record their measurements as 62^1 long by 32 u broad. 

Habitat. Ston;ach of the African elephant (South Africa and 
 Uganda). 

Pteridopharynx anisa Khalil, 1922. (Text-figs. 47-51,) 
 Source of mate7'ial. â€” The matei-ial consists of more than thirty 

specimens. These I sorted out from the lai-ge stock of jiarasites 

collected by Prof. Leipei- in Uganda.
