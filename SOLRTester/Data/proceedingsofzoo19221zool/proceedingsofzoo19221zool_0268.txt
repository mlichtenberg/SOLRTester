Nerve collar, — The small nerve collar surrounds the thinnest 
 part of the oesophagus '25 mm. from the head end. 

Genital organs. — Male : The convoluted testis gives rise to the 
 ejaculatory duct. This pierces the enormously elongated cement 
 gland to end in the cloaca. 

Female : The female is viviparous ; the embr3^os reach an 
 advanced stage of maturity, and so distend the uterus as to make 
 the examination of other structures difficult. The convoluted 
 ovary is single, and leads to the enormously dilated uterus. The 
 short vagina opens on the surface of the body -06 mm. in front of 
 the anus. The convolutions of the ovary reach within "52 mm. 
 of the head end.

Leiperenia galehi Khalil. Tail end of male. 

Spictdes. — There are two unequal spicules and an accessory 
 piece. The longer spicule is '25 mm. long; thus it is shorter 
 than that of the type-species. It lies in the axis of the body, 
 midway between the ventral and dorsal surfaces. Near its 
 lower end it bends boldly ventrally to pass into the cloaca. The 
 shorter spicule is 'IS mm. Jong. It is very slightly curved, lying 
 by the side of the terminal portion of the longer spicule. The 
 accessoiy piece is "13 mm. long. It has a thick bulbous end, and 
 is gradually attenuated to end in a sharp point buried in the 
 posterior lip of the cloacal opening. It lies practically across the 
 axis of the body. 

The tail. — The male tail is gracefully curved and is "43 mm. 
 in length. Its end is bluntly rounded. There are a group of four 
 papillse similar to those in L. leiperi. They are situated '17 mm. 
 from the tip of the tail. Two papillte are in the middle line, one
