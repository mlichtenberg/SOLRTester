li' . Prepuce not withdrawn into common integumental sac 
 with anus, but remote from that orilice. 
 j. A small pointed soft hippet in the middle line below the 
 urino-s'enital orifice and projecting between its labia, 

as in Ociodon and Ctenomj/s Caprami/s. 

j'. No lappet below the urino-geiiital orifice. 

k. Walls of glandular pouch spicular, not distinctly 
 laminated, with merely two low rounded ridges 

running down the anterior wall Dolicliotis. 

k'. Walls of glandular pouch with numerous compressed 
 ridge-like laminse. 

I. Apex of glaiis broad and truncated CkincJiilla. 

I'. Apex of glans attenuated Myocastor. 

The Genital Organs of the Female. 

The genital apparatus in the female Hijstrioa and Acanthion 
 appeai-s externally as a large triangular prominence, marked on 
 its posterior surface by a longitudinal slit. Separation of the labia 
 of the slit reveals the orifice of the vulva above, and just beneath 
 the latter the orifice of the urethral canal. Some distance beneath 
 the urethra and near the apex of the integumental prominence is 
 a trilobed clitoris, with a shallow glandular depression above or 
 in front of its apex. The lateral lobes can be folded over so as 
 to meet each other in the middle line and form a partial tube for 
 the passage of the urine. In the impaired female only one orifice 
 is superficially detectable above the clitoris. The condition is 
 very similar in J. i^er^M•«, except that the clitoris has a simple 
 conical apex with the orifice of the urethra near its tip, and 
 therefore farther from the vulva than in Hystrix. (Text-fig. 26, 
 A, D, E.) 

In Erethizon and Coendu the anal and genital area of the 
 female is bordered on each side by a ridge of integument running 
 from the root of the tail to the clitoris. The vulva is a tolerably 
 large orifice situated a little below the anus, and the urethra 
 is a smaller orifice beneath the vulva and above the tip of the 
 clitoris, which has a glandular pouch just below and in front 
 of it, and the clitoris is protected by a short projection of hairy 
 integument corresponding to the prepuce of the male. The 
 condition is thus very much the same as that of Hystrix and 
 Atherura. In Coendu the integument round the urino-genital 
 orifices is naked, whereas in Erethizon there is a considerable 
 quantity of hair round the orifices. (Text-fig. 26, F, G.) 

In Myocastor the vulva is an arched transverse orifice close 
 beneath the anus in the middle of the naked area above described. 
 A little way beneath it is the short, conical, slightly hairy clitoris, 
 which is perforated at the tip by the orifice of the urethra, 
 (Text-fig. 27, A, B.) 

In Capromys the vulva is a little way beneath the anus, and 
 below it the prepuce of the clitoris, which is long in the adult, 
 projects downwards and backwards. It has a few hairs at the 
 tip, which bears a large bilabiate orifice. (Text-fig. 27, C, D.) 

In Octodon the vulva is a large transverse orifice close beneath
