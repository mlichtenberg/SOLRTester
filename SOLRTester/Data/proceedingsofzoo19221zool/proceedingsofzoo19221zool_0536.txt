460 MESOPTERYGOID IN CERTAIN REPTILIAN SKULLS. 

Crossopterygians. Now, however, this difficulty has been removed 
 by the descri})tion of the palate of Eusthenopteron foordi by 
 Bryant*, and we have the clue to the little element in both 
 Gonodectes and the lizards (text-fig. 7). As will be seen from the 
 fio-ure, there is a large bone which has on its outer side a palatine, 
 and an ectoj^terygoid, and which is manifestly the pterygoid of the 
 higher forms. Internally it articulates with a long, slender bone 
 which is the mesopterygoid of the bony fishes. This mesoptery- 
 goid is supported by the parasphenoid or vomer. The relations 
 of all the bones is very similar to what we have in the higher 
 forms, and the only striking difference is that in the Tetrapods 
 the mesopterygoid has become greatly reduced and usually lost. 
 But when it is retained it is found, as in the E,hipidistian fish, 
 suppoi'ting the pyterygoid and itself articulating with the basi- 
 pterygoid process of the basisphenoid or the parasphenoid. 

There is one other group of fossil reptiles in which it is 
 possible there is also a distinct mesopterygoid. Sollast, in 
 describing recently the skull of Ichthyosauo^us from serial sections, 
 showed that there are two epipterygoid-like elements on each 
 side. The posterior pair are, I think, manifestly the true epi- 
 pterygoids. Not improbably the anterior pair will prove to be 
 mesopterygoids, which in the specimen examined by Sollas had 
 been slightly displaced outwards by crushing.
