84 MR. F. BALFOUR-BROWNE ON THE LIFE-HISTORY 

make a loud, strident noise, which it does by rubbing the apex of 
 the abdomen against the underside of the apices of the elytra, in 
 which position is a file-like structure {vide PI. III. fig. 6). Both 
 sexes are alike in this. The beetle " squeaks " when it is alarmed 
 or annoyed ; for instance, when it is caught in the water-net or 
 held between finger and thumb. In my tumblers, if one 
 individual tried to seize a piece of worm upon which another 
 was feeding, the latter " squeaked," the squeak in this case 
 presumably being equivalent to the growl of a dog with a bone. 

3 (d) Sexual differences. 

There is very little difference in outward appearance between 
 the sexes, the larger tarsal pads of the male being about the only 
 one. The female is slightly la.rger than the male on the avernge 
 and perhaps slightly broader in proportion to length. 

(4) Life-liistory . 

The beetle is to be found in its habitat from March until 
 October. In the latter month it descends into the mud in the 
 bottom of the pond to hibernate, apparently remaining there 
 without moving, its legs and antennae folded in against the bod}', 
 until the following spring. Early in March, or possibly some- 
 times late in February, it reappears and towards the end of 
 March oviposition commences. 

4 (a) Oviposition. 

In t]\e laboratory my earliest date for the appearance of eggs 
 is March 23rd, but under natural conditions eggs are very scarce 
 until about the second week of April, when they become common. 

Whereas Dytiscid eggs are buried in the tissues of plants, the 
 females possessing piercing ovipositors, Pelohius eggs are laid 
 upon the surface of sub-aquatic vegetation. In m^^ tumblers and 
 tubs the eggs were laid in rows, end to end, sometimes as many 
 as eight to ten in a row, though odd eggs were also to be found. 

WJien about to oviposit the female lies along the plant stem, 
 clasping it with her legs so that the apex of her abdomen touches 
 the stem. The egg, which is blunt oval in form, J '5 mm. long 
 by '87 mm. bi'oad and equallj^ curved at both ends, is very clear 
 at the moment of extrusion and enclosed in a thin gelatinous 
 envelope which at once adheres to the plant. This envelope 
 quickly absorbs water and swells up into a thick protective 
 covering. 

Having laid an egg the beetle moves slowh' forward, waving 
 her antennpe in the water and usually touching the stem with 
 her palpi. She \noves just far enough to permit the next egg to 
 emerge so that it will touch the end of the previous egg, and in 
 this way she works along the stem, producing a string of eggs.
