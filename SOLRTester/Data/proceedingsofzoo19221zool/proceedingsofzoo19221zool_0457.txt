is a small tragus and a moderately laroe antitragvxs. (Text- 
 fig. 7, A.) 

The ear of Dolichotis is much longer than in Cmna or 
 Coelogenys, and is somewhat narrowed above by the tolerably 
 deep and long emargi nation of its supero-posterior edge. The 
 supratragus is a simple ridge without the thickening seen in 
 Gcelogen.ijs. The continuation of the antero-internal ridge is very 
 distinct and long, longer than in Cvelogenys, but equally simple 
 in structiu'e. Beneath it there is a similar ridge curving abruptly 
 downwards to end in a thickening above the auditory orifice. 
 The tragus is quite well developed and high, but the antitragus 
 is not better developed than in Cavicc. (Text-fig. 7, C.) 

In Hydrochcerus the ear is very much simplified, the only 
 strongly developed ridge being the supratragus, which terminates 
 somewhat abruptly near the middle of the cavity. The antero- 
 internal ridge is not turned backwards beneath the supratragus, 
 but gradually fades away inferiorly. There is no definite tragus 
 or antitragal thickening, and the ridge representing the latter is 
 not continued so high as the posterior end of the supratragus. 
 The depression in which the orifice lies is thickly overgrown Avith 
 hairs covered with waxy secretion, the two combining to exclude 
 water. (Text-fig. 7, C.) 

The ear of Layostomus trichodactylus is very specialised, but 
 seems to be an extreme modification of some such type as that 
 seen in Coelogenys. Its laminate portion is very much larger 
 and is tolerably evenly oval. There is a v/ell-developed tragus 
 separated by a large notch from the antitragal portion, which, 
 however, does not form a thickened bulge as in Coelogenys, but is 
 continued obliquely upwards and backwards as a long straightish 
 sharp ridge defined behind by a shallow depression running in- 
 feriorly into a shallow pouch, doubtless homologous to the 
 similarly placed pouch above and behind the antitragus in 
 Coelogenys. The backwardly curved continuation of the a,ntero- 
 internal ridge is strong and forms the lower border of a deep 
 depression, bordered above by the thickening representing the 
 suprati'agus, but this does not form a definite ridge as in most of 
 the ears hitherto described. (Text-fig. 7, F.) 

Tiie ear of Chinchilla is tolerably similar in tj^pe to that of 
 Lagostomus, but is mvich more expanded, except a,t the base 
 where it is narrower and more tubular, so that the orifice lies 
 deeper in the ear at the bottom of the depression bordered abovo 
 by the continuation of the antero-internal ridge. No trace of 
 the supratragus remains. The tragus, too, has disappeared ; but 
 the a.ntitragus is developed into a prominence relatively as large 
 as in Coelogenys ; and this is hollowed into a deep pocket, from 
 the centre of which arises a straight ridge corresponding to the 
 similar straight lidge in Lagostomus and to the curved ridge 
 defining the cavity of the ear posteriorly in Coelogenys. (Text- 
 fig. 7, E.)
