anterior part of the wall of the subcircular cavity of the ear con- 
 taining the large exposed anrlitory orifice, the tragus, antiti'agus, 
 and the intervening notch being ol)literated. The antero-internal 
 ridge, forming the continuation of the strongly overfokled an- 
 terior rim of the ear, gradually disappears inferioily at about the 
 level of the orifice and does not curve shai-ply backwards beneath 
 the supratragus, (Text-fig. 6, M.) 

In Ccelogenys this ridge beneath the supratragus is much more 
 sharply defined and forms the lower edge of a well-defined depres- 
 sion, of which the supratragus, which has a definite thickening, 
 is the upper border, and above the supratragus there is another 
 weaker I'idge. There is a small tragus, but the antitragus is very 
 large and thick, and is marked above and posteriorly by a small 
 shallow pouch. Above this pouch the antitragus is continuous 
 with a ridge curving foi'wards above and forming the posterior 
 rim of the cavity of the eai'. The laminate portion of the eai- is 
 small, but erect, with a slight emargination near the middle of its 
 posterior border, a rounded summit, and an overturned anterior 
 margin continuous below with the aiitero-internal ridge. (Text- 
 fig. 7, D.) 

The ear of Dasyprocta is wider as compared with its height 
 than in Ccelogenys. As in that genus the inferior end of the 
 overturned anterior rim juts into the cavity, forming a horizontal 
 shelf-like ridge beneath the supratragus, which is itself a long 
 narrow ridge with a well-defined depression above it. There is a 
 small tragus as in Ccelogenys, but the antitragus is much less 
 developed than in that genus and has no pouch above it. Above 
 the tragus there is a little curled thickening, (Text-fig. 6, F.) 

In Cavia and allied genera the ear resembles tolerably closely 
 in shape that of Dasyprocta, although varying within the limits 
 of the genus. But it always dift'ers in having the supratragus 
 converted into a laminate valvular flap. In Galea littoralis the 
 ridge beneath the supratragus, which is also present in Dasyprocta 
 and Ccelogenys, is quite bhin and of uniform width throughout ; 
 the tragus is distinctly defined, and above it there is a thickening 
 recalling that seen in Dasyprocta but larger ; the antitragus, too, 
 is well developed, and the portion of the pinna below and behind 
 it is comparatively wide, wider than in Dasyprocta. But in Cavia 
 aperea and the Common Guinea-pig {C. porcellus) the ridge 
 beneath the supratragus is large and valvular, like the supra- 
 tragus itself, there is scaxcely a trace of tragal and antitragal 
 tliickenings, and the pinna is narrower behind the antitragal 
 ridge. When the ear of the Guinea-pig is folded the two valves 
 close down over the orifice, the supratragal valve lying upper- 
 most. The ear of Kerodon resembles that of the two last- 
 mentioned species of Cavia, although the two valves are relatively 
 a little smaller and the tragus and antitragus are a little better 
 developed. (Text-fig. 6, G, H.) 

The ear of Thrynomys, like that of Cavia, has the supratragus 
 valvular and the antero-internal ridge passing beneath it. There
