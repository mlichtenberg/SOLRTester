AND SOME ANTELOPES OF ANGOLA. 333 

The call of this Zebra is a low, snuffling neigh oi^ whinny, 
 quite unlilce the oft-repeated hysterical " bweha-bweha" of Bonte 
 Quagga. It also makes a loud squeal. 

The flesh is fine-grained, with white fat and sinews, and by no 
 means bad eating with a slightly sweet taste. That of the Bonte 
 Quagga is coarse, rank, and unpalatable, in colour dai'k red with 
 yellow fat and sinews.

On preparing to work out the Angolan Springbucks, the first 
 difficulty to be encountered was the usuallack of material. Apart 
 from the Angolan series, only two complete skins with skulls 
 could be found in the B. M. collection, and one of these was a 
 stufi:ed specimen. The remainder consisted of stuffed heads from 
 the Selous collection and a few ancient relics without histories. 
 There is, moreover, very little literature giving any detailed 
 description of " this Antelope for the reason that its highly- 
 specialized character so readily distinguishes it from all others. 

Harris t gives a careful description, and Brooke J follows with 
 another careful and accurate description, upon which I base the 
 differences found in the Angolan series. 

Even from the scrappy material available it is evident that 
 two distinct races exist, the most obvious character of the one 
 being the imperfect development of the horns in the female, 
 which are small, thin, and indistinctly annulated, and of the 
 other the fully-developed horns in the female, which are long, 
 lyrate, and strongly annulated. 

Other difi'ei-ences appear in the skulls, to which reference will 
 be made later, bat it is first necessary accurately to define typical 
 euchore. 

The best examples to be found representing anything ap- 
 proaching a series are four specimens from the Orange River
