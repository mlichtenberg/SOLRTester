there included, nor with any otlier Divaricatje approaching this 
 gi'oup. Each of the half-dozen main branches I'amifies iriegularly 
 in a llabellate fashion, but there tends to be a predominance of 
 secondary branches to the one surface, though the surface is 
 richly beset with small, almost sessile bundles of polyps, which 
 also occur all over the cortex. These small bundles may, of 
 course, be young stages of twigs. 

3. Colotcriny. Predominantly of a brilliant red. The cortex 
 is vividly coloui'ed except at the beginning of the polyparium. 
 where it is almost white. On the branches and twigs all the 
 spicules are deep red. 

4. Polyp stalks very short. 

5. Polyps. A somewhat marked feature is the small number 
 (3-6) of polyps in each bundle and the frequency of isolated 
 single polyps. 

6. Polyp spicules. The anthocodial 
 armature consists of 8 strong points, 
 each composed of 2 rough hockey-club 
 spicules rising from a strongly-developed 
 crown of 4-5 practically horizontal rough 
 spindles. A deceptive appearance arises 
 in many cases where the non-retracted 
 state of the polyp brings the crown 
 spicules into a chevron arrangement in 
 a line with the upper pair of what I 
 take to be the point proper. The two 
 hockey clubs, which form a narrow 
 isosceles triangle, are seen in other cases 
 in the normal relation of points to 
 crown, and it may be noted that they 
 are distinctly larger than those beneath 
 them. Between every two points there 
 are usually two intei'mediates. On the whole in anthocodial 
 structure the arrangement is nearest to that of D. cirsium. The 
 anthocodial spicules are almost white, but show a faint yellowish 
 tinge. They are characteristically rough, with relatively large, 
 very blunt tubercles, not densely crowded. 

The supporting bundle is well developed and inclined to be of 
 the sheath type, showing 3 spindles much larger than the rest- â€” 
 that is to say, a median and two laterals abutted by numerous 
 smaller ones, which show a tendency to be in parallel lines sloping 
 towards the support. The median spindle usually projects for 
 about 0-5 mm., and the two laterals project sometimes a very 
 little. The supporting sheath spicules are spindles often curved 
 and densely covered with short, rounded tubercles. 

7. Other spicules. On the sterile stalk are large, broad, rough, 
 yellowish spindles connected by small inteilocking irregular 
 reddish forms which pioduce an arenaceous appearance. The 
 cortex here bears a variety of spicules, all thickly covered with 
 rather massive, blunt, rough tubercles, sometimes compound and
