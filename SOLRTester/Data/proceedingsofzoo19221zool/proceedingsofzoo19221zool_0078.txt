D. clavata with no canal-wall spicules belongs to what I would 
 call the more pi-imitive types. So careful a worker as Kiikenthal 
 attaches great importance to the canal-wall system of spicviles, 
 and it is obviously important to inquire what cori'elation there is 
 between the primitivenpss of a species and the number and 
 nature of the canal-wall spicules. The unsatisfactory feature 
 here is that the examination of the canal-wall spiculation has not 
 been made uniformly by the various investigators. Minute 
 spicules which escape attention in 
 a fragment of canal - wall when Text-fie-. 5. 

boiled down may be found by the 
 other method of examining a piece 
 intact. But one is not uniformly 
 successful with the sample examined. c^ad 

§ 8. Bearing in mind the first of the 
 above assumptions, it is possible to ex- 
 pand it so as to reduce all the difierent 
 species to one or other of the follow- 
 ing six grades, ranging from the most 
 primitive (I.) to the most specialized 
 (VI.) :- 

YI. Only one pair of spicules, or 

even btit a single spicule re- „ 

placing all the others in each 
 point above the crown ; 

V. reduction of the point that one 
 pair (or, it may be, one of the 
 uppermost pair) predominates 
 over the others, which are not 
 above three pairs in total 
 number above the ci'own ; /\

III. about 4-6 pairs, the uppermost 
 slightly specialized, no crown ;

§ 9. The suggestion has been made by critics of Dendroneiph- 
 tliija species that the diflerences between the Glomerate, Divari- 
 cate, and Umbellate groups are not of taxonomic value, but
