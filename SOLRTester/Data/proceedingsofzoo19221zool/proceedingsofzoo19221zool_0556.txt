480 THE SECRETARY ON ADDITIONS TO THE MENAGERIE. 

permanent retention of the larval organisation may ))e re^ai'ded 
 as definitely established hy the work of Gudernatsch, Bennet 
 Allen, Hoskins, Swingle, Morse, Uhlenhuth, and othei's. There 
 are ample indications th;i,t the thyroid gland is not alone in 
 influencing the developmental processes of Batrachians. Several 
 recent workers, notably Allen, have demonstrated the failure of 
 Anuran tadpoles to undergo metamorphosis after the ablation 
 of the pituitary (anterior lobe) rudiment. But our knowledge of 
 the function of this organ is very slight. 

" A short while ago the author, in collaboration with Mr, 
 Julian Huxley, independently confirmed Laufberger and Jensen's 
 claim to have induced sexually mature larva? of the neotenous 
 Mexican Salamander to assume the adult form by treatment with 
 ii diet of mammalian thyroid. It was not possible after many 
 attempts to obtain this result with pituitary (anterior lobe) gland 
 substance administered per os. Recently it has been found 
 possible to induce year-old Axolotls in Prof. MacBride's laboratory 
 ,at the Imperial College of Science to transform after tri-weekly 
 intravenous injections of anterior lobe extracts. The injections 
 of '3 cc. Ringer extract of equivalent to 2 grains fresh gland (ox) 
 were made via the anterior abdominal vein. The animals were 
 fed on raw beef tri-weekly, and kept in deep water till the 
 completion of metamorphosis at the conclusion of one month 
 from the beginning of the treatment. The time required by this 
 method is tlius the same as that in the case of thyroid dieting — 
 conspicuously less than with the shallow-water treatment of 
 Mile, de Chauvin and E. G. Boulen^er."
