(1) The Family Pelobiidte. 

The family Pelobiidse contains the single genus Pelohius and 
 only four species, one of which is European, one Chinese, and 
 two Australian. The family holds a somewhat isolated position, 
 being related to the Carabidae and showing similarities of struc- 
 ture with Dytiscidse and other aquatic beetles of the series 
 Adephaga, these being due, according to Sharp (10)*, not to 
 close relationship but to adaptation to life in the water. 

(2) Britannic Distribution. 

The single European species is not uncommon in Britain, but 
 belongs to the Southern or "English" type, as defined by 
 Watson (16), being chiefly found in the Southern and Eastern 
 counties of England. It has been recorded from one Scottish,
