The literature of the Primates contains very few references to 
 the structure of the Drill, so an account of its anatomy should 
 be useful. The present description is based on the examination 
 of an adult male which died in the Society's Gardens. It had 
 the following proportions : — 

Length from tip of nose to root of tail ... 29-5 inches. 

Tail 3-5 „ 

Length of head 9 ,, 

„ body 20-5 „ 

Arm .... 8 „ 

Forearm 8*6 „ 

Thigh 9-5 „ 

Leg 8-7 „ 

Myology. 

The platysma myoides is strongly developed in both neck and 
 face, and has a well-mai-ked attachment to the lips. The muscles 
 of the lips and frontal region are also very strong and thick ; and 
 it is to their great development that the frequent movements of 
 scalp and exposure of the teeth are due. 

The ternporal and masseter muscles are powerful, and the upper 
 part of the latter is concealed by the parotid gland ftext-fig. 9). 
 But the full, rounded muscle is seen beyond the limits of the 
 gland. The former appears as a well-marked prominence above 
 the zygoma as in many of the Carnivora. 

The arrangement of the vessels and nerves on the surface of 
 these muscles differs from that in many Primates and Cai-nivora,
