362 MISS L. E, cnEESMAN : OBSERVATIONS ON 

Sense of Hearing. — No sign of response to any soiuul could be 
 obtained. During the expei'iment with flashlight mentioned 
 above, it seemed unlikely that the report of the concussion was 
 noticed ; it was the light alone which had a disturbing effect, 
 because two of the crabs were at an equal distance from the 
 light as that specimen which was being experimented iipon, but 
 the former were shaded from the glare by a piece of cork- 
 bark. The two which were exposed to the sound but not to the 
 light were carefully observed during the I'eports but made no 
 movement. 

Sense of Taste and Smell. — The seat of this sense must be inside 
 the mouth, possibly on the mandibular palp ; stones, morsels of 
 brick, and upon one occasion seaweed, were taken into the mouth, 
 and it wns fully two minutes before they were rejected as 
 inedible. The former could be heard distinctly to grate against 
 the mandibles. The antennules are not used in connexion with 
 food ; they are principally used when the crab is undei- water, 
 and may test the salinity of the water. 

Sense of Touch. — Setse are scattered over the limbs, and as the 
 crab moves sideways some of these are continually in contact 
 with the ground and reveal the nature of the surface nnd the 
 presence of food. Although the crab is undisturbed by any 
 vibration of the aii', there is immediate reaction to a vibration of 
 the ground. If a smart tap be given to the wooden partition 
 of the bay when the crabs have their backs against it, they will 
 respond to each tap by swinging the eyes into the sockets ; or 
 will move away as though alarmed. The tufts of setseat the base 
 of the claw of the first pair of walking legs are in constant 
 requisition while the crabs are feeding, to touch the food before 
 it is conveyed to the mouth. 

Further Observations on the Habits. 

Food. — Dead leaves and twigs form the main food of this species 
 in captivity. They also eat fresh fish and mice. They refvised 
 stale meat, but one night a mouse which had broken into the bay 
 was caught by a crab, and by morning was half devoured. They 
 were then supplied regularly with dead mice, and averaged about 
 one in every three days. After nearly eight weeks they refused 
 this diet and returned to vegetarianism, broken by an occasional 
 meal of fresh fish or an occasional mouse ; but they prefer all 
 flesh food very fresh. It was during this surfeit of mice that 
 their attitude of toleration towards one another was renounced 
 for combativeness, and five specimens died of injuries caused by 
 entire limbs being severed from the body. With the change of 
 diet this pugnacious mood subsided, and the chief aggressor now 
 lives peaceably with two smaller specimens. 

Method of Catching and Eating Mice. — The actual capture of a 
 live mouse has not been witnessed. When two live mice were 
 put into the bay one evening they showed a contemptuous
