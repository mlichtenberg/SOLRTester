Parabroxema africana Baylis, 1921. 

This species was apparently mistaken by Baird for female 
 G>'ammocephalus clathratus. It was isolated and described from 
 the original matei'ial by Baylis in 1921, but Leiper in his 
 notes in 1911 recorded and drew this species from material in 
 the Berlin IMiiseum, where it was kept under the name Ascaris 
 lonchoptera. He recognized this mistake in diagnosis, and added 
 that the same species is included wrongly by Baird in his type 
 of G. clathratus in the Natural Histoiy iMuseum of London. 

The male is 40 mm. and the female is 57 mm. in length. 
 The lips have a median inward projection on their opposed edges. 
 Yulva is placed just caudad or cephalad of the end of the 
 cesophagns. The left spicule is 3'15 mm. long and the right is 
 0'68 mm. The male tail is 0*85 mm. and the female' tail is 
 0"52 mm. in length. 

Habitat. Stomach-wall of the African elephant (died in 
 London). 

Parabroxema smithii Cobbcld, 1882. (Text-figs. 8-12.) 

Filaria smithii Cobbold, 1882 (not Filar ia smithi Sambon, 
 1907, from the Grouse Lagojnis scoticus). 

Spiroptera smithi Raill., Henry & Bauche, 1914. 

Parabronema smithi Baylis, 1921. 

Source of Material. — The material consisted of one male and 
 three females sent from the Raymond Laboratories. Calcutta. 
 They were collected from an Indian elephant. 

Skajye of body. — Very small nematodes. The females much 
 larger than the males The male is 4"1 mm. long and the 
 female 8 mm. The maximum diameter of the body is about 
 the middle of the worm, being 0*2 mm. in the male and -26 mm. 
 in the female. The female is always curved, the tail directed 
 dorsally. The tail of the male is spirally coiled ventrally. 

Skin. — The cuticle is very finely striated throughout the 
 length of the body. 

The head. — The cuticle surrounding the head end is raised from. 
 the surface of the body, forming a complicated design. Its caudal 
 mai'gin surrounds the circumference of the body 0"083 mm. from 
 the head end. It forms six auricular appendages, two lateral, 
 two subventral, and two subdorsal. Each auricle is open towards 
 the head. Their posterior margin is nearly flat, unlike the 
 rounded appearance in F. indic^im or the angular appearance in 
 F. africana. Each of the two latei-al lips bears thiee papilla?, a 
 large one near the centre and two smaller ones near the margin 
 on either side. The ciiticular shields lower down bear four 
 papillae. The terminal extremity of the head is 0*03 mm. in 
 diameter. 

Cervical papiUce. — The cervical papilla? are placed 0"209 mm. 
 from the head end. 

Digestive system. — There is a buccal cavity just behind the oral
