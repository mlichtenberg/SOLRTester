In comparing skins of nige?- with those of variani, the most 
 striking difterences are found in the females, for whereas in the 
 males of the latter a greater intensification of colour is shown, in 
 the females the colour is quite distinct. 

In true Sable the prevailing colour of the females is a sombre 
 brow)i, very old examples becoming almost as black as the males, 
 but of a more rusty hue. In variani the females are of a brilliant 
 golden-chestnut colour, and never assume the black livery of the 
 males. A very old female may develop a deeper chestnut hue, 
 Imt there is no suggestion of black, as is seen in young males 
 while still in an adolescent stage. 

General I)escri2'>tion of H. variani. 

Male. A massive upstanding Antelope, almost as large as equinus 
 but not so high in the leg. The foreface is long and narrow, the 
 forehead not so high and prominent as in niger, with immense 
 horns rising perpendicularly from above the eyes and curving back- 
 wards in an individually variable arc. There is usually a wide 
 outward sweep towards the tips; more rarely the horns are 
 parallel throughout their length. They are much compressed 
 laterally, with very strong annulations, A section through them 
 taken 8" above the base measures roughly 34" X 2". The annu- 
 lations have a tendency to become obliterated on their lateral 
 surfaces centrally, especially on the inside. Grood horns may 
 measure 58", with girth 10|" ; but a length of 64" has been 
 I'ecorded . The unannulated terminal portion is generally straight. 
 For this reason, coupled with their perpendicular rise from the 
 frontals, the ends of the horns, when the animal is standing erect, 
 do not as a rule curve downwards, but are carried more or less 
 parallel to the line of the back. 

The ears are comparatively small in fully adult males. In 
 voung males and in the females the ears are larger. 

The neck is full, short, massive, oval in section, and wedge- 
 shaped from above downwards. The mane, which is full and
