CHARACTERS OF SOME HYSTIiICOMOH^lI RODENTS. 371 

In Hydrochcenis the rhinarium is scarcely defined, although 
 the skin between the nostrils is naked. The nostrils are very 
 widely separated and small, without any postero-lateral slit 
 The upper lip is exceedingly deep and naked or scantily haiiy 
 in the middle. 

The rhinarium of Gtenodactylus is continued to the edge of the 
 upper lip by a naked area of skin, which, like the rhinarium 
 itself, is capable of lateral compression, being broad or narrow 
 according to the degree of contraction of the muzzle. The upper 
 end of this labial tract is continued on each side as a naked rim 
 beneath the nostrils. The upper edge of the rhinaiium is 
 convex with a median angular emargination. The area above 
 the nostrils is deep ; the nostrils themselves when expanded are 
 large orifices with very short posterior slits, and the narrow space 
 between them is marked by a deep median groove extending 
 from the top of the labial ti-act to the summit of the rhinarium. 
 (Text-fig. 4, G.) 

In view of the former association of Gtenodactylus with the 
 Jerboas (Jaculidse) it is interesting to note the close similarity 
 between that genus and Jaculii,s in the rhinarium, not only in 
 structural details but in its compressibility. 

Facial Vibrissce. 

In P. Z. S. 1914, pp. 903-905, I described briefly the facial 
 vibrisstB of several species of Hystricomorpha belonging to the 
 genera Atherura, Coendu, Erethizon, Octodon, Chinchilla, Lago- 
 stomas, Dolichotis, Coilogenys, Dasyprocta, Gavia, and Hydro- 
 choerus, and showed the general constancy of the presence of 
 well-developed mystacial, superciliary, and genal tufts, the latter 
 being usually set high up the face near or even behind the 
 posterior angle of the eye. Since then I have extended my 
 observations, and can add several more species to the list. 

In Hystrix, Acanthion, Atherura, and Trichys the vibrissse are 
 as originally desci^bed in Atherura, namely, exceedingly long 
 and well developed, and there is always an interramal tuft. In 
 Thrynomys, on the contrary, although its mode of life is tolerably 
 similar to that of the Old World Porcupines, the mystacials are 
 comparatively slender and short, and in two dried skins I can 
 find no trace either of superciliary, genal, or interramal tufts in 
 the coarse hairs clothing the head. Peters described the mysta- 
 cials as long in Dinomys and the genals as set behind the eye, 
 but says nothing about the interramal tuft. 

In the genera of Loncherinse figured by Winge, namely, 
 Loncheres, Echimys, Cannahateomys, Trichomys {Nelomys), 
 Garterodon, and Mesomys, well-developed mystacial, superciliary, 
 and genal vibrissfe, the latter behind the eye, are shown, but no 
 interramal tuft is indicated. The omission of the interramal tuft 
 can hardly be taken as proof of its absence in these genera. 
 Nevertheless, I failed to find it in examples of Gtenoritys and
