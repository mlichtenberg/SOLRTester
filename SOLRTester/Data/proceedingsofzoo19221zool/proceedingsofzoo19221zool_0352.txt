Three males and one female from Laugbian Peaks, S. Annam, 
 6500 ft. 

This species is distinguishable from A. atomaria Sim. by its 
 more uniform colour, freedom from spots on the cephalothorax 
 and legs, as well as the more even length of the latter, of which 
 the second pair is the longest. 

Genus Palystes L. Koch. 

Palystes ledleyi, sp. n. 

Female. The cephalothorax is j'ellow-brown, with fine down- 
 lying pale yellow-brown hair scolloped against a paler area at 
 the rear ; on the clypeus whitish yellow. The mandibles are 
 brown with brown hair. The fangs dark red-brown. The lip, 
 maxillfe, sternum, and coxae pale yellow-brown. The remaining 
 joints of the legs and palpi are darker, the hairing ashy grey 
 under the femora and on the scopul?©, otherwise yellow-brown. 

The abdomen is pale yellow, with fine, short, smooth, yellow- 
 brown hair above and four muscle-spots rather darker in a 
 trapezium, narrowest in front. 

The under side is similar in colour, with a dark grey triangular 
 pattern between the genital fold and the spinnerets, and three 
 longitudinal lines in the middle. 

The cephalothorax is highest just in front of the rear slope 
 and declines to the eye-space ; it is rounded at the sides, and 
 narrows in front to one-half its greatest width. The mandibles 
 are as long as the front is wide, per-pendicular, convex. On the 
 inner margin of the falx-sheath are three large teeth followed by 
 one smaller, and low down on the outer one large between two 
 smaller. 

The rear row of eyes is slightly recurved, the median their 
 diameter apart, and 14 of same from the laterals, which are also
