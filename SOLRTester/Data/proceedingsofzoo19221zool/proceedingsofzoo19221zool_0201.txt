SYMPATHETIC NERVES OF HYRAX CAPENSIS. 155 

the aortic plexus ( A.P), vewa azygos majof (Az.ISr), thoracic nerves, 
 and left sympathetic. 

In the abdomen the mesial division divides into two, and the 
 following are the fibres of distribution : — 

1. To the cfpliac ganolion (A). 

2. Hepatic plexus (contained in A). 

3. Phrenic plexus (contained in A). 

4. Fibres to the right renal plexus (E-.R.P). 

5. Fibres to Meckel's Tract and Duodenum (M.B). 

6. Fibres to the colon (C.B). 

The abdominal part lies close to the left sympathetic and fibres 
 connect them. It gives ofi' the right renal plexus (R.R.P), right 
 spermatic plexus (R.S.P). and filaments to the aortic plexus. 

The Cardiac Plexus consists almost entirely of the deep part, 
 the superficial plexus consisting only of a few filaments derived 
 from it. The nerves entering into it are : — 

1. Three branches of the left vagus. 

2. A twig from the left recurrent nerve. 

3. A branch from the inferior cervical ganglion of the left 
 sympathetic. 

4. Two blanches from the right recurrent nerve. 

5. Two bi-anches from the right vagus. 

No ganglia are present, nor are there separate depressor nerves ; 
 but these may be contained in the loops uniting the superior and 
 recurrent laryngeal nerves. Ofi'shoots of the plexus can be traced 
 into the pulmonary and ti-acheal plexuses. 

The Aortic Plexus (A.P) derives its fibres from the two sympa- 
 thetic cords, the'bridge between the vagi in the thorax, and the 
 solar plexus. 

The Solar Plexus (text-fig. 7) : — In the upper jjart of the 
 abdomen dorsad of the stomach there is a, broad band of fibres 
 with a large reddish-brown semilunar ganglion at its left 
 extremity. The fibres are closely packed and have wide con- 
 nections as follows : — 

1. The splanchnic nerves from the left sympathetic cord 
 entering the anterior pole of the ganglion (A). 

2. Two bundles of fibres from the left sympathetic cord 
 entering the mesial border of the ganglion (B). 

3. Fibres from the right vagus to the large left splanchnic 
 nerve (C). 

4. Fibres from the right vagus to the semilunar ganglion (D). 

5. Fibres from the left vagus to the semilunar ganglion (E). 

6. Fibres from the right vagus running into the plexus and 
 turning down to the splenic plexus (F). 

7. Fibres from the semilunar ganglion to the splenic plexus (G). 

8. Branches from the solar to the splenic plexus (H). 

9. Branches from the right sympathetic to the semilunar 
 ganglion (I). 

lb. Hepatic plexus (J) giving off pyloro-duodenal nerves (K). 
 11. Diaphragmatic plexus (L).
