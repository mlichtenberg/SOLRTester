CHARACTERS OF SOME IIYSTRICOMORPH RODENTS. 419 

In Ccelogenys the anus forms a large prominence near the middle 
 of a naked area of skin which extends in front of the tail above 
 and of the penis or clitoris below. The anal glands are repre- 
 sented externally by a pair of small pouches opening one on each 
 side of the termination of the rectum Avithin the sphincter of 
 the anus. (Text-fig. 28. D.) 

Dasyprocta seems to resemble Ccelogenys in having paired 
 lateral anal glands. 

The anus in bp.th sexes of DoUchotis is in the upper half of an 
 area of naked skin which extends inferiorly beneath the genito- 
 urinary orgaiis, and is separated from the tail above by a fringe 
 of hairs. When the anus is opened the orifices of the anal 
 glands appear as a pair of oblique slits set one on each side above 
 the termination of the rectum. The orifice leads into a shallow 
 hair-lined pouch. (Text-figs. 23, A, B ; 28, C.) 

In Cavia porcellus the anus is situated near the summit of a 
 large naked area which extends downwards to the prepuce in 
 both sexes ; but it is normally concealed from view by being- 
 folded into a depression common to it and the anal glands. This 
 depression appears superficially as a median groove. When this 
 is dilated it resolves itself in the female into a pair of pits 
 separated by a low partition, and situated between the anus and 
 the vulva. In the male the pits are much larger and longer 
 and when distended to the fullest extent appear as a single 
 capacious pouch owing to the depression of the partition between 
 them. When partially closed the floor of the pouch rises to 
 form a low partition between the pouches. A female C. aperea 
 resembles 0. po?'ceUus in the features mentioned above. But a 
 male example of Gcdea littoralis difiers very considerably from 
 the male of C. porcellus. The anus is at the summit of a large 
 naked or nearly naked area extending down to the penis ; but 
 this area, overlying the testes, shows no trace of glandular 
 depression, the anus being exposed, as in Dasyprocta and other 
 genera. I failed to find the anal glands in a spirit-preserved 
 specimen. Kerodon apparently resembles Cavia in the structure 
 of the anal region, but I have seen no fresh material, (Text- 
 figs. 23, F-H ; 28, B.) 

In both sexes of Hydrochcei'us the anus and external genitalia 
 are packed closely together, as if contained by a common sphincter, 
 upon a nearly naked prominence, some distance beneath the tail. 
 Between the anus and the penis or vulva there is a short perineal 
 area, hairier in the male than in the female, and on each side of 
 this lies a long vertical slit which leads into a large pouch, lined 
 with hair, which pi-ojects from the orifice, and filled with secre- 
 tion. At the bottom of each of these pouches there is a strip of 
 naked skin with a row of four or five little pits, and beneath 
 this strip the dermis is thickened and glandular. (Text-figs. 24, 
 A, E ; 28, A.) 

In Otenodactylus the anus opens just beneath the root of 
 the short, tapering, unifor-mly hairy tail, at the summit of an
