l)etter-et|uipped two-arched forms, and we can at present only 
 examine the very specialised aquatic modifications that survived. 
 Jifoovila is probably the only w-ell-known land-form. Arwosceles 
 is probably also a member of the group, but so very early that it 
 still retains the true coracoid. In no other is a true coracoid 
 known. The Mesosaurs are very early aquatic modifications. 
 The Ichtliyosaurs are much later aquatic forms. The Plesiosaurs 
 and Placodonts and Ohelonians are, I believe, all descended from 
 land forms closely similar to Youngina, but with only the upper 
 temporal fossa developed. 

This group of primitive lizard-like forms, which had only the 
 upper temporal fossa developed, and their aquatic descendants 
 the Mesosaurs, the Ichthyosaurs, the Plesiosaurs, and Placodonts, 
 together with the very highly specialised Ohelonians, which I 
 consider to be all related, I proposed to unite in a fourth 
 subclass, which I suggest may be called the Anomapsida.
