In Janviary 1922, I collected a number of ISTematode parasites 
 from the caica of two Bristly Ground Squirrels (Xerus setostis) 
 which had been received from South Africa, a month previously, 
 by the Zoological Society, Regent's Park, London. These parasites 
 comprised 11 males and 17 females. They were irregular] v 
 distributed in the ctecal contents. 

In the specimens, which were all killed by immersion in hot 
 70 per cent, alcohol, the anterior end of the body is bent ventral- 
 wai'ds in the form of a hook. 

The caticle is transversely striated, the distance between the 
 most anterior strite being slightly over 7 /x ; this distance increases 
 posteriorly until a maximum of 27 /a is i-eached at about one- 
 seventh of the total length of the worm ; after this the distance 
 gradually diminishes, so that in the middle of the body it is 12 u 
 and at the hinder end 7ju. 

A mouth collar (text-figs. 1 & 2) is present ; this is broad 
 and shallow, its depth being less than hall its breadth. Immedi- 
 ately behind it thei'e is a well-marked vesicular swelling about 
 as long as it is broad, but sometimes slightly longer than broad 
 (text-fig. 1). Transversely it shows fine cuticular striations. It 
 is terminated behind at a distance of about 220^ from the 
 anterior end by a cervical constriction of the cuticle ; this con- 
 striction almost encircles the worm except for a short space on 
 the dorsal surface. 

Two cervical papillce are present ; these are small, and are 
 situated behind the middle of the oesophagus at about the 
 anterior margin of the posterior third of the oesophagus. 

There are no lateral alee. 

The females are slightly longer and thicker than the males,, 
 measuring on an average 15 mm. in length, the smallest being 

13 mm. and the largest 16-5 mm. long. In the males the average 
 length is 13 mm,, the smallest being 12 mm. and the laig-est 

14 mm. 

The females have their maximum breadth at the junction of 
 the posterior and middle thirds of the body, and this breadth in a 
 female 16 mm. long is 510//. From this point the body tapers
