Most characteristic of this land of stones is this big Mountain 
 Zebra, a fair cousin of the true Zebra of the Cape, now almost 
 extinct. 

Orio-inally described by Matschie from Huanib and Uniab on 
 the coast N. of Waliisch Bay, and later by Thomas fiom a speci- 
 men presented Ijy Mr. G. W. Penrice from the Moninha River 
 N.E. of Mossamedes, there can be little doubt that the two are 
 one and the same animal. My specimens were collected near the 
 coast at Elephant Bay, 100 miles N. of Mossamedes, and corre- 
 spond accurately with Matschie's original description. 

Habitat. 

The home of this Zebra- appears to be in the coastal belt of 
 8. W. Africa where the country is rocky and precipitous. I have 
 seen the spoor on the wet sand of the sea-shore at low tide, and 
 have often watched them grazing on the low-lying flats and on 
 the plateau-like tops of the adjacent cliffs within a mile of the 
 sea. According to Mr. Tyler Thompson's observations, witii 
 which my own coincide, they do not penetrate further than 
 30 miles inland, and are strictly confined to the waterless desert 

Description. 

gl-ull. — A comparison of the skulls of zebra with hartmannce 
 shows slight differences only, the latter being more massive. 

Zebra shows modifications of the frontal aspect between and 
 below the orbits. There is a depression along the naso-frontal 
 suture. The nasals also are depressed centrally, and the maxillae 
 are compressed laterally above the infra-orbital foramen. 

Hartmannoi has the frontal profile straight, the nasals straight, 
 and no lateral compression of the maxillae in the region of the 
 nasals. 

In zebra in the flesh, the profile is dished or dented in between 
 the rather prominent field of the forehead and the muzzle, as is 
 seen in an Arab horse. 

In hartmannce the whole profile is flat with a descending 
 muzzle, giving the head a Roman-nosed appearance. 

There is also noticeable at the anterior end of the malar, near 
 its junction with the maxilla, on the inferior surface of the malar- 
 maxillary ridge and in line with the last molar, a roughened bony 
 spur. This is not noticeable either in zebra, quagga, or grevyi, 
 and has probably been developed for the attachment of a more 
 powerful muscle to meet some special requirement of mastication. 

fSkin. — Direction of hair as in zebra,. Resembles zebra in colour- 
 pattern, except that the relative areas occupied by dark stripe and
