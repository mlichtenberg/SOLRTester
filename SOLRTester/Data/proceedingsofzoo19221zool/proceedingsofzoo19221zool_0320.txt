Nerve collar. — This is placed '2 inin. from the head suvrounding 
 the oesophagus. 

Genital organs. — Male : The irregularly convoluted testes reach 
 within 2-5 mm. of the head extremity. There is a dilated 
 seminal vesicle. The ejaculatory duct traverses the long cement 
 gland to terminate in the cloaca. 

Female : The vagina pursues a vertical course in the long 
 axis of the body. It is -52 mm. long. Into its cephalic end the 
 two strongly muscular ovejectors open, each connected with the 
 corresponding uterus. The two uteri lie side by side, lying 
 mainly in the axis of the body. The irregularly convoluted ovary 
 reaches within 2*75 mm. of the head end.

Bursa. — The bursa is distinctly divided into three lobes. 
 The dorsal lobe is much longer than the lateral. The bursa 
 is smaller than that of M. vieni^yhisia, but corresponds to it in 
 shape and in the arrangement of the rays. It is "5 mm. in length 
 and '45 mm. in breadth. The ventral and lateral rays are similar 
 to the coi'responding rays in the type-species. The fourth division 
 of the lateral ray is shorter and knob-like. The externo-dorsal 
 ray does not reach the edge of the bursa. It gives off near its 
 origin a small ray, which is characteristic of the genus. It is 
 shorter than that in M. inemjyhisia, being "05 mm. in length, 
 and its end is pointed.
