Haviug determined the quantity and charted the distiibution 
 of the bottom animals in the Danish Seas (" Valuation of the 
 Sea," I, and 11. : Reports XX. and XXL, from the Danish 
 Biological Station, 1911 and 1913), Dr. 0. G. Joh. Petersen in 
 1914 published an appendix to Report XXL (in Reports from 
 the Danish Biological Station, XXIL, 1914), in which he, on the 
 basis of various statements in the litei*ature, gave a hypothetical 
 chart of the animal communities outside Denmark. In this 
 the North Sea is charted as chiefly a " Vemis ''-community, with 
 the '^ Macoma bcdtica" commvxnity in some places along the 
 shore, and an area in the deeper parts of the North Sea, marked 
 with a ?, in which several indications in the literature suggested 
 the occurrence of a " Brissopsis "-community. In the month 
 of July 1921 1 was enabled to accompany the English Fishery 
 Research vessel ' George Bligh ' on a cruise across the North Sea 
 from Lowestoft to Esbjerg, during which Dr. Petersen's bottom 
 sampler, " the Petersen Grab," was used ; by the courtesy of the 
 Director of Fishery Investigations, Dr. E. S. Russell,! was given 
 permission to work out and publish the material procured. 
 Though the route followed did not touch the deeper parts of the 
 North Sea, as will be seen from the accompanying chart of the 
 stations (p. 30), and consequently cannot give information about 
 the existence or not of the ''Brissopsis " area mentioned above, still 
 the 20 stations worked during this cruise can be of service in 
 giving a preliminary orientation of the communities in the 
 Southern North Sea. 

In the accompanying Valuation List the stations have been 
 arranged in communities. It will be seen that with some 
 hesitation I have referred the first two stations to the " Veuus"- 
 community. These two stations contain, however, too few 
 bottom animals to settle the question. Among the characteristic 
 species of the " Macoma bcdtica" community, which, with the 
 kind help of Captain Davis, I found in large quantities by digging 
 along the shore-line at ebb-tide in the harbour of Lowestoft, viz., 
 Macoma bcdtica, Scrobicularia plana, Mya arenaria, and Carclium 
 eclule, only one small Mya arenaria was found, at Station 2 ; 
 whereas a representative of tlie " Epi-Fauna " of this community, 
 viz. Mytilus eclulis, is present in numbers at this station. On the 
 other hand, a small Ofhioglypha cOMcla and two Natica cdderi point
