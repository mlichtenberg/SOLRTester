TIOMPOIIAL ARCUKS OF THE REPTJLIA. 19 

allied Ctqytorhinus. But whether or not the reptiles have been 
 derived from a Labyrinthodont or even a SeymouriaAike ancestor 
 need not at present concern ns, as we have a temporal roof in 
 Pantylas primitive enough to have been the origin of all the 
 later types of temporal regions seen in higher reptiles. Those 
 who believe that in many later reptiles, such as IcJuhyosaitrus, 
 rieurosauriis, and others, we still have a well-developed supia- 
 temporal element, must necessarily derive them from an ancestral 
 type such as we have in Fantylv.s, where the supi'atemporal is 
 still preserved. Personall}^, I am of opinion that all the so-called 
 supratemporal bones in later reptiles are really tabulars, that the 
 supratemporal was very early lost never to reappear, and that a 
 temporal region such as we have in Captorkimis gives us a better 
 idea of the ancestral reptilian temporal roof than any other 
 well-known animal. 

It is, of course, a point which might be debated at considei^able 
 length whether it is the tabular which is lost and the supia- 
 temporal retained in the primitive Diapsids or the supratemporal 
 lost. The evidence is not as convincing as one would desire; 
 but, as I am showing elsewhere, there seems good reason to believe 
 tha,t the upper bone in the temporal region of the lizard is the 
 tabular, and in the most lizard-like of the Cotylosams such as 
 Procoloj^hon it is certainly the tabular that is retained and the 
 supratemporal lost, so we are pi-obably justified in concluding that 
 except in a few primitive Ootylosaurs such as Pantylus and 
 Diadectes a supratemporal is never found in reptilian skulls. 

Gaptorhinus, though it has all the ancestral elements of the 
 temporal region and onl}^ those that are met with in most later 
 reptiles, is considerably specialised. The squamosal is probably 
 considerably larger than in the more genei^alised ancestor, and 
 the tabular is certainly more reduced than it must have been. 
 Still the type as seen in Captorhinus is our best starting-point for 
 tracing the evolution of the temporal region. 

In all the Maiiimal-like reptiles there seems to me no reason- 
 able doubt that the temporal condition has arisen by an opening- 
 forming between the postorbital and the squamosal, exactly as 
 figured bj'^ Versluys in his " tSynapsider Typus I." *. This leaves, 
 when the opening is well formed, a temporal fossa bounded above 
 by the postorbital and â€¢ squamosal, and below by the jugal and 
 squamosal. In Dtametrodon and Gorgonops and Gcdepus we find 
 this type of fossa, and there is no doubt that, even where as in 
 Cynodonts and some others, the parietal forms part of the temporal 
 border, the condition is a secondary one. 

The Mammal-like reptiles with this single lower temporal fossa 
 form a very natural grovip, to which the name Synapsida has been 
 given by Osborn. 

There is another group of reptiles which, having also a single
