Two previous papers by me on Mendelian experiments in Fowl 
 breeding have been published in the ' Proceedings of the Zoological 
 Societ3^' The last, in the volume for 1919, described the pro- 
 duction of a recessive pile from a cross between a Silky hen 
 and a hanklva cock. The present paper records the I'esults of a 
 cross between a dominant white, namely White Leghorn, and 
 Black-red Game, made with the object of finding whether a 
 dominant pile v/ould result. 

In March 1919 I purchased from a Yorkshire breeder a Black- 
 red Game cock, which was stated to be pure-bred, and mated it 
 with two white Leghorn hens kindly supplied by Mr. Seth 
 Smith from poultry in the Society's possession. From these 
 parents two broods of chickens were hatched — the first on April 
 27-28th, the second about May 10th. There were eight chicks 
 in each brood. 

The colour of the down of these chicks was canary yellow, 
 darker round the neck, and diminishing to white behind and 
 below, but none were pure white all over. There was no sign of 
 stripes. Bateson (' Principles of Heredity,' 1909, p. 102) states 
 that the F^ ofTspring of White Leghorn by Indian Game or 
 Brown Leghorn is, when newly hatched, white with a few specks 
 of black. There may be some breeds of fowls which are pure 
 white in the down, but all that I have studied are not white but 
 yellow or fawn colour. It is well known that young ducklings of 
 white breeds are yellow in the down. Several of the chicks of 
 my cross had one or more black spots and others had black and 
 red specks on the head, but I was not able at the first examination 
 to take them up and examine them closely. The absence of 
 striping is interesting. The chicks in the down of the Japanese 
 Long-tails which I bred some years ago, and, I believe, the chicks 
 of Black-red Game and of Game fowls, generally have a median 
 dorsal dark brown stripe and two lateral stripes of the sawe 
 colour, the rest of the dowii being fawn colour or bufl'. The 
 recessive or non-coloured chicks from the cross of Silky by G- 
 hankiva had yellow down on the body generally with white 
 stripes in place of the dark stripes of the coloured chicks. 
 According to Bateson the chicks of pure-bred Silkies have the 
 same mai'king as this. It would seem, therefore, that in the 
 cross White Leghorn by Black-red the dominance of the white
