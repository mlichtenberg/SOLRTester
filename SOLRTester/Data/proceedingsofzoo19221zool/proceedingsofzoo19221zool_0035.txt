FAUXA OF EAST AFRICA. 3 

marabou storks in myri.ads, all gorged to repletion. Occasionally- 
 dead giraffe, waterbnck, and IdusIi buck were seen ; the eland also 
 snftered, and I am told that kudu and roan wei'e also attacked. 

From the bufialo the disease spread to the cattle, and at 
 Ngomeni in North-East Kitui, which was a great cattle centre 
 before the epidemic, we were shown some 20 odd beasts, the 
 sole survivors of many thousand head, and the desiccated carcases 
 of the victims were piled up as a wall outside the villages. 

It was during that journey that we happened to follow a day 
 behind a. large hiijn of Laikipia Masai which was engaged in 
 raiding the Embu and Mbe tribes. I will not dwell on the 
 •evidences of ruthless slaughter we witnessed, but some fifteen years 
 later I was recalling the incident to the chief of the Laikipia 
 Masai, and he laconically told me that he was a "morau" or 
 vv'arrior at the time and had participated in the raid ; he paren- 
 thetically added that it was an unfortunate ventui'e, for some of 
 the captured cattle were infected with rinderpest, and so they 
 took the disease back to their own herds on Laikipia and practi- 
 ■callv all perished. Nemesis indeed I 

This outbreak was the woi'st epidemic known in the recent 
 history of Africa.; it spread rapidly south through what was then 
 'German East Africa, crossed the Zambezi, reached Buluwayo 
 about 1895, and by the end of 1896 it had reached the Cape. 
 During the last year of the visitation its progress was remarkably 
 rapid, viz., about 1000 miles ; it was probably spread to a great 
 extent by the transport riders. Since that devastating attack we 
 have had minor epidemics of the disease; in 1904 I saw eland 
 dying of it near Naivasha, and the Masai then lost over 600 head 
 of stock. Although sporadic outbreaks still occur, this disease is 
 now well in hand. 

In very dry years, when grazing is scarce and the plains are 
 very dusty, outbreaks of anthrax occur among the game, the 
 principal species to suffer being Coke's hartebeest ; the last 
 serious outbreak which was identified was in 1905, when several 
 thousand heaxl of game died on the Athi Plains. 

Pleuro-pneumonia is rarely absent from the herds of Masai 
 cattle grazing in the South Reserve ; but, curiously enough, there 
 is no record of the disease a,ttacking the game, and the Game 
 Warden has stated that cases are known where eland and buffalo 
 graze over the same land as cattle infected with this disease and 
 ■are apparently unaffected. 

About 1906 an epidemic of what is believed to be distemper 
 broke out among the jackals on the Athi Plains, and large numbers 
 died ; a year or two later the same disease was recorded from the 
 Rift Yalley, and then from Laikipia. It is not, however, known 
 whether the disease is endemic, or whether it has been introduced 
 by civilization. 

Wild game is in some areas infected to a considerable extent 
 Avith intestinal parasites. I have frequently observed the intra- 
 muscular cysts of what is commonly called ''measles" in mpala,
