Tilapia nigricans (part.) Bouleng. Cat. Afr. Fish. iii. p. 240, 
 %. 160. 

Tilcqna simoies Bouleng. t. c. p. 242, fig. 161. 

Depth of body 2| to 3 in length, length of head 3 to 3^. 
 Snout decurved, about as long as diameter of eye, which is 3| to 
 3| in length of head, greater tlian prteorbital depth, equal 
 to mterorbital width. Jaws equal or lower jaw a little the 
 shorter, short and broid, about ^ length of head ; maxillary 
 reaching A^ertical from anterior edge of eye or a little beyond ; 
 teeth slender, cuspidate, in 6 to 8 series, outer but little enlarged 
 and not separated by a distinct interspace from inner ; 40 to 70 
 in outer series of upper jaw. 3 or 4 series of scales on cheek. 

7 to 10 gill-rakers on lower part of anterior arch. Pharyngeal 
 teeth small. 31 to 33 scales in a longitudinal series, 5 or 7 from 
 origin of dorsal to lateral line. Dorsal XY-XVI 9-10 ; last 
 spine i length of head. Anal III 8-9 ; third spine nearly as 
 long as last dorsal. Pectoral a little shorter than head, not 
 reaching anal. Caudal truncate or subtrancate. Caudal peduncle 
 as long as or a little longer than deep. Brownish or greyish, 
 with traces of blackish cross-bars ; males with 2 to 4 ocelli on 
 anal. 

Nine specimens, including types of T. nigricans and T. simotes, 
 70 to 145 mm. in total length, and a skeleton. 

Boulenger's figures show T. nigricans as having quite a 
 difterent physiognomy from 2\ simotes, but this is because the 
 head is directed upwards in the former.

Depth of body 2| in length, length of head 3 to 3-^. Snout 
 with straight profile, about as long as diameter of eye, which is 
 3^ to 3| in length of head, greater than prteorbital depth, equal 
 to or greater than depth of cheek ; intei-orbital width 34- to 3., in 
 length of head. Jaws equal or lower slightly projecting ; rami 
 of lower jaw longer and more slender than in H. nigricans, 
 about i length of head. Teeth as in the preceding species, in 5 to 

8 series, 50 to 80 in outer series of upper jaw. 2 or 3 series of 
 scales on cheek. 9 to 11 gill-rakers on lower part of anterior 
 arch. Pharyngeal teeth small, 31 to 33 scales in a longitudinal 
 series, 5 or 6 from origin of dorsal to lateral line. Dorsal XY- 
 X.YI 9-10 ; last spine h length of head. Anal III 9-10 ; third 
 spiue I" to k head. Pectoral as long as or a little shorter than
