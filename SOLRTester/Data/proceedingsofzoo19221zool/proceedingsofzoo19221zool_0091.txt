WITHIN THE GENUS DENURONEPHTHYA. 53 

Should be referred to Kiikenthal's Divaricate and section 
 divaricata, within Avhich they approach D. mollis. 

3. Coloioring. General surface white, anthocodial armature 
 and supporting bundles reddish brown in the largest specimen. 
 In the two younger colonies the anthocodial and supporting- 
 bundle spicules are amber-yellow. The fourth colony is ivory- 
 white. 

4. Polyp stalks about 1 mm. long. Text-ti^'. 13. 

5. Polyps arranged in groups of about 
 ten in number. 

6. Polyp spicules. One of the upper- 
 most pair of spicules in at least some of 
 the 8 points is strong, out of proportion 
 to the others and projects very markedly 
 beyond the polyp. The other spindles 
 of the points are small and converging, 
 and there may be 4 pairs of them. In 
 many cases the large projecting spindle 
 has fallen off, a.nd its attachment seems 
 to be very loose. 

The supporting bundle is very strongly d. mollis Holm 

developed and 3 or so of its component 

spicules project beyond the polyp for over 1 mm. The spindles 
 are densely and regularly covered with very small blunt tubercles, 
 while here a.nd there almost smooth forms occur. 

7. Other spicules. Those of the short stalk include, besides 
 spindles much rougher than those of the anthocodite and more 
 curved, various triradiate and smaller irregular quadriradiate 
 forms. 

Locality : — Amboina Reef. 

The two young divaricate colonies with amber-yellow antho- 
 codial and supporting-bundle spicules have distinct flattening, 
 and show what we regard as essential characteristics of D. mollis, 
 viz : — 

(1) a very mai-ked projection of one of the uppermost spicules 

of each point in the anthocodial armature ; 

(2) the presence of 3 or 4 other pairs of smaller spicules 

converging en chevron ; 

(3) the practical absence of any crown ; 

(4) the very strong supporting bundle with 3 specially strong 

spicules, one of which projects beyond the others for 
 about one millimetre ; 

(5) the dense regular covering of the anthocodial, supporting- 

bundle, and coenenchyma spicules Avith short blunt 
 tubercles ; 

(6) the prevalence on the short stalk of much rougher spindles 

(straight, ciu'ved, and much curved), with much longer and 
 more distant tubercles, and along with these numerous, 
 irregularly shaped, roughly tuberculate forms.
