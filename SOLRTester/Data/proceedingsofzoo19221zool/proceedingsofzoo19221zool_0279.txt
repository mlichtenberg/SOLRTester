PARASITES OF ELEPHANTS. 223 

precedence. Von Linstow described in 190G Strongylus rectus 
 from Dolichotis patagonica. 

According to Article 36 of the International Law of Zoological 
 Nomenclature, the specific name rectum, 1907, must be rejected 
 and can never be used again. 

This is in complete agreement with the views expressed by 
 Lane. He rightl}' was unable to arrive at the conclnsion that 
 the nematode desciibed by von Linstow belongs to the genus 
 Murshidia, because the original description and figures are A'ery 
 unsatisfactory. Onl^- tlie figure of the male bursa shows any 
 marked resemblance to Murshidia. 

I have been fortunate in having access to a series of cameva- 
 lucida drawings of von Linstow's original material in Berlin 
 Natural History Museum, made by Prof. Leiper and very 
 generously placed at my disposal. Unfortunately, the exact 
 magnification was not noted, and therefore von Linstow's measure- 
 ments are relied upon, as they correspond in proportion to the 
 camera-lucida drawings. 

The mouth capsule is wide, surrounded by a chitinous ring of 
 the shape characteristic of the genus. The oesophagus is short 
 and thick. The excretoiy pore is placed a considerable distance 
 caudad of the oesophagus. The vulva is suiTounded by raised 
 cuticle, specially cephalad. The male bursa is short and the 
 lateral rays are not rugged in outline. The spicules are straight 
 and sharply bent near their terminations, which are bulbous in 
 shape. (For details of measurements see Table I.) 

Habitat. From the African elephant (Cameroon). 

Murshidia hadia Khalil, 1922. (Text-figs. 15-21.) 

Material. — The material consisted of one male and four females, 
 selected from Prof. Leiper's collection of Elephant nematodes. 

Shape of hod)/. — The body of the male is straight, the female 
 tail is slightly bent ventrally. The mule is 18-5 mm. long and 
 tlie female is 24 mm. long. The maximum diameter of both sexes 
 is about the middle, being -67 mm. in the male and -82 mm. in 
 the female. The antero-posterior diameter of the male body just 
 cephalad of the bursa is "55 mm. This is a little smaller than the 
 diameter at the middle of the body. 

Skin. — The cuticle is finely striated at intervals of -009 mm. 

Mouth collar .—This, is well developed and rounded in out- 
 line. It is "05 mm. long and '2 mm. in diameter. It is distinctly 
 separated from the rest of the body by a deep groove. 

External leaf-crown. — Arising from the inner surface of the 
 mouth collar is the external leaf-crown, consisting of forty rays. 
 These rays are longer laterally than ventrally or dorsally. Each 
 rny is narrow and gradually tapers to a point. 

Head papillce. — There are the usual four submedian head 
 papillse. They project freely above the head. Each is sur- 
 mounted by a small knob which, as already mentioned, represents
