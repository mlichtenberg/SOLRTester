is reduced to 2 pairs or to 1 pair, these occupy the same space as 
 3-6 rows. 'J.'he larger numbers 5-6 were certainly less frequent 
 than the rest. 

There is not in this case any confusion between what might be 
 counted to points and what to crown, for in no case did I see 
 what in other species is called a crown. It is also striking that 
 after an examination of scores of anthocodife hardly any case of 
 intermediate spicules between the points was found. 

The supporting bundle is enormously developed. Its largest 
 spicules may attain to a length of 6 mm, and project for 1-5 mm. 
 These large spindles are densely covered with minute, blunt, 
 thorns, except for 0'6 mm, at the projecting tip, which is smooth, 
 as is also the case in D. gigantea. Very marked in the large 
 supporting-bundle spicules of the colony (Station 240) is the 
 disappearance of the red colour from the proximal third of most 
 of the largest. The same tendency is to be recognized in the 
 yellow colonies, 

7, Other spicules. The spindles of the upper cortex are often 
 up to 4 mm. in length. They are covered with large, blunt, 
 truncate and sometimes compound Avarts, and they lie trans- 
 versely. Many show an abrupt narrowing at one end. In the 
 lower cortex and canal-walls there are numerous stouter and 
 shorter spindles exceeding 1 mm, in length and bearing crowded, 
 rough tubercles often compound. Large tiiradiates and multi- 
 radiates also occur, besides bracket-like and quite irregular forms 
 approaching the stellate type, A few curiously starfish-like forms 
 occur, and triradiates with one arm exuberantly branched. Many 
 much smaller counterparts of the large types occur. There are 
 also occasional long, narrow spindles. 

Within the hemprichi group the specimens a.gree best with 
 B. gigantea, though this may not be obvious at fii"st sight. Many 
 of the anthocodiae show but one pair of spicules in each point, 
 which suggests approximation to D. carnea, D. dcederleini, and 
 £>. punicea. From the first they are at once separated by the 
 massive spicules, which are visible from a distance and lie in very 
 regular transverse rows. This conflicts too seriously with the 
 original description by Wright and Studer (p, 196), where it is 

said : " The stem and branches are leathery and thickly 

packed with fine spicules. The latter are not recognisable by the 
 unassisted eye and lie scattered confusedly in several layers," 
 Both from D. dcederleini and from B. punicea they are sufficiently 
 separated by the enormous strength of the supporting bundle. 

Deduction : — The specimens agree more closely with D. gigantea 
 than with any other Glomerate known to me, and not least in 
 showing quite an unusual degree of variability. Among the 
 important features of agreement the following may be noted : — 

(1) the very characteristic plump hemispherical masses closely 

beset with polyps ; 

(2) the supporting bundle of great strength and showing many
