number piles and half black-reds. At the same time it is to be 
 noted that the pile coloration in these birds was more pronounced 
 and more uniform than in the heterozygotes of F^, whereas if 
 the F., mothers had been pure dominants, there is no reason why 
 the offspring of F., DD's with the RR black-red should have any 
 more colour than the DR's of F^. 

If we regard the dominant white as one character and the 
 black-red colour as its allelomorph, the evidence of these 
 experiments seems to show both imperfect dominance and 
 incomplete segregation. The pile produced by my cross, and 
 probably the pile of fanciers also, is a heterozygote, like the blue 
 Andalusian, and it should produce in the F^ generation whites, 
 piles, and black-reds in the proportion 1:2:1. In F^ the white 
 is not a complete dominant ; it suppresses the black colour almost 
 but not quite completely, but the red colour was developed in 
 varying degrees in the piles, eight cocks and four hens, while the 
 other three hens showed only scattered specks of blaclv and red. 

In the F, generation both groups A and B were the offspring 
 of heterozygotes, the parents of A being of the pile coloration, 
 those of B showing greater dominance of white. The two groups 
 may be compared thus : â€” 

F,, Group A. 

Kecessives. 

2 $ , one black and one grey, each with 

some white feathers. 

Heterozygotes. 
 5 $ deep pile to pale pile. 

3 $ dark pile to rather pale lacing. 

? Dominants. 
 2 (J very pale pile. 
 1 $ white with trace of reddish lacing 
 neck. 

F^ Group B. 

Recessives. 
 1 $ reddish brown with black specks. 

Heterozygotes. 

3 $: one moderate pile with a few black 

marks, two pale piles with spots of 
 black, or orange and black. 

4 $ : two typical piles, two j-ellow on 

head and hackle, with many black 
 spots. 

? Dominants. 

5 $ very pale piles, two with onl3' a 

slight tinge of yellow on back of 
 wings, perhaps not more than occurs 
 occasionally in Leghorn cocks. 
 4 $ white with scattered specks of 
 black or grey. 

But while, as this table shows, the recessives can be definitely 
 distinguished from the heterozygotes, it is not possible to separf^te 
 the pure dominants from the heterozygotes. In the whitest birds 
 there are some traces of colour, and the amount of colour forms a 
 continuous series from the typical pile cock and hen to the birds 
 with least colour. In the recessive hens also there are distinct 
 traces of white. The segregation therefore is imperfect.
