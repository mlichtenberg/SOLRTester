Discussion. 

This genus has some points in common with the genus Atractis. 
 The latter was made by Dujardin to include Ascaris dactyUris of 
 Rudolphi, 1819, but was not defined. The genus was defined by 
 von Linstow in 1902. From von Linstow's description, together 
 with a detailed account of the type-species by Railliet and Henry, 
 Leiperenia can be easily separated by the following characters :— 

In Atractis there are six lips surrounding the mouth. There 
 are no cuticular membranous expansions in the anterior part of the 
 body. The oesophagus is divided into two portions, of which the 
 anterior is the longer. The number of the conical processes is 
 limited to six. There is a cuticular expansion along the posterior 
 two-thirds of the body. The species of Atractis are parasitic in 
 Land and Freshwater Tortoises and Reptilia.
