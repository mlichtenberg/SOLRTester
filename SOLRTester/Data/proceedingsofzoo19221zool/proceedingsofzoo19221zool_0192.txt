found a number of cases where there were additional female 
 pores one segment behind the normal, and where therefore there 
 were probably additional ovaries and oviducts internally to 
 correspond. 

The testes which we suppose to have disappefired from 
 segment xii also sometimes crop up again. Thus Woodward (28) 
 found testes here in three cases out of fifty examined. Beddard 
 (4) found a pair of testes in segment xii in Fontoscolex corethrurus 
 (in this case the gonads of segment xiii also appeared to be 
 testes). 

On the other hand, the gonads of segment xii, which ought, 
 when they reappear (if the common ancestor of earthworms was 
 constituted as above supposed), to be testes, ai'e when present 
 sometimes ovaries. Beddard (I. c.) found this to be so in some 
 examples of Fontoscolex ; it is so (if we may draw conclusions 
 from the position of the female pores) in some specimens of 
 Perionyx excavatus (Beddard, Z.c); and Woodward had six cases 
 of this condition out of the fifty specimens of British earthworms 
 Avhich he examined. 

In a number of cases the nature of the gonad in segment xii 
 is indeterminable, or the evidence is inconclusive. Beddard 
 {I. c.) believes that the same gland in Fontoscolex may produce 
 either ova or spermatozoa. In one specimen examined micro- 
 scopically by Woodward the gland was actually hermaphrodite. 
 In three very young specimens (? of Lumbricns ritbellus) a gonad 
 was present on each side in segment xii, but at that stage could 
 not be identified as definitely testis or ovary (Woodward suggests 
 that this pair is always developed in the embryo). Beddard 
 (5, 8) found this pair of glands present in embryos of Octochcetus 
 vmltiporus, but of course could not identify it, at that stage, as 
 either testis or ovary. Beddard also notes (9) that two pairs of 
 ovisacs have been found both by Horst and himself in certain 
 species of Perichsetidfe, in segments xiii and xiv ; these would 
 correspond to ovaries in xii and xiii ; Beddard remarks on 
 certain resemblances of these organs to sperm-sacs, and, since 
 neither gonads were found in segment xii nor ova in the corre- 
 sponding sacs, it seems not improbable that the organs in 
 segment xiii were vestigial sperm-sacs, and the gonads which 
 formerly existed in segment xii were testes. 

There is thus no doubt that ovaries occur not infrequently at 
 the present day in segment xiv, and that segment xii also 
 frequently contains a pair of gonads, which in some cases are 
 ovaries, in some cases testes, and in some cases their nature is 
 equivocal. According to our view they were, in the ancestral 
 eai^th worms, regularly testes. 

The more usual view of the origin of the terrestrial Oligochaeta 
 (Beddard, 9; Michaelsen, 12, 17) is rather different. The 
 Phreoryctida?, with two pairs of testes and two pairs of ovaries, in
